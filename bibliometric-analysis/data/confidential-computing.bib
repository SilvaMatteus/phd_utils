	abstract = {Cloud computing provisions computer resources at a cost-effective way based on demand. Therefore it has become a viable solution for big data analytics and artificial intelligence which have been widely adopted in various domain science. Data security in certain fields such as biomedical research remains a major concern when moving their workflows to cloud, because cloud environments are generally outsourced which are more exposed to risks. We present a secure cloud architecture and describes how it enables workflow packaging and scheduling while keeping its data, logic and computation secure in transit, in use and at rest.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00142},
	abstract = {Intel's SGX is a confidential computing technique. It allows key functionalities of C/C++/native applications to be confidentially executed in hardware enclaves. However, numerous cloud applications are written in Java. For supporting their confidential computing, state-of-the-art approaches deploy Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) in enclaves and perform confidential computing on JVMs. Meanwhile, these JVM-in-enclave solutions still suffer from serious limitations, such as heavy overheads of running JVMs in enclaves, large attack surfaces, and deep computation stacks. To mitigate the above limitations, we for-malize a Secure Closed-World (SCW) principle and then propose Lejacon, a lightweight and efficient approach to Java confidential computing. The key idea is, given a Java application, to (1) separately compile its confidential computing tasks into a bundle of Native Confidential Computing (NCC) services; (2) run the NCC services in enclaves on the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) side, and meanwhile run the non-confidential code on a JVM on the Rich Execution Environment (REE) side. The two sides interact with each other, protecting confidential computing tasks and as well keeping the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) size small. We implement Lejacon and evaluate it against OcclumJ (a state-of-the-art JVM-in-enclave solution) on a set of benchmarks using the BouncyCastle cryptography library. The evaluation results clearly show the strengths of Lejacon: it achieves compet-itive performance in running Java confidential code in enclaves; compared with OcclumJ, Lejacon achieves speedups by up to 16.2x in running confidential code and also reduces the TCB sizes by 90+\% on average.},

	doi = {10.1109/SCC49832.2020.00023},
	abstract = {Recently, cloud platforms play an essential role in large-scale big data analytics and especially running scientific workflows. In contrast to traditional on-premise computing environments, where the number of resources is bounded, cloud computing can provide practically unlimited resources to a workflow application based on a pay-as-you-go pricing model. One challenge of using cloud computing is the protection of the privacy of the confidential workflow's tasks, whose proprietary algorithm implementations are intellectual properties of the respective stakeholders. Another one is the monetary cost optimization of executing workflows in the cloud while satisfying a user-defined deadline. In this paper, we use the Intel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) as a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to support the confidentiality of individual workflow tasks. Based on this, we propose a deadline-constrained and SGX-aware workflow scheduling algorithm, called SEED (SGX, Efficient, Effective, Deadline Constrained), to address these two challenges. SEED features several heuristics, including exploiting the longest critical paths and reuse of extra times in existing virtual machine instances. Our experiments show that SEED outperforms the representative algorithm, IC-PCP, in most cases in monetary cost while satisfying the given user-defined deadline. To our best knowledge, this is the first workflow scheduling algorithm that considers protecting the confidentiality of workflow tasks in a public cloud computing environment.},

In this study, we propose a confidential document file sharing technique that allows only limited users to access and check the contents. The proposed technique uses encryption technology and uses a key management system. Due to these characteristics, only pre-defined users can access. As a result of verifying the function to confirm the effectiveness of the targeted confidential document technique, it was confirmed that all the targeted functions were provided. Because this study uses encryption technology, the performance is slower than the legacy method. Additional research is needed to improve this.},

	abstract = {The migration of traditional deployment to clouds has driven the need for a more robust security model, the Zero-Trust model. The application of zero-trust principles addresses known security issues such as lateral movement attacks but adds extra identity management complexity. In addition, to cover a broader range of attacks, one must think of strategies to protect data, code, and credentials in such applications. Confidential computing aims to fulfill this goal. Nevertheless, confidential computing is even more complex to implement than Zero-Trust. In this work, we combine the Zero-Trust model with confidential computing by leveraging the SPIFFE standard through its reference implementation (SPIRE), and Intel SGX through the SCONE framework, to seamlessly supply software identities to confidential microservices. Furthermore, we also protected the whole identity-provisioning stack with Intel SGX and assessed the performance overhead. We believe this combination not only improves the security of SPIFFE deployments but also leverages SPIFFE to facilitate the integration between confidential computing components and native applications.},

	abstract = {Demand for data-intensive workloads and confidential computing are the prominent research directions shaping the future of cloud computing. Computer architectures are evolving to accommodate the computing of large data. Meanwhile, a plethora of works has explored protecting the confidentiality of the in-cloud computation in the context of hardware-based secure enclaves. However, the approach has faced challenges in achieving efficient large data computation. In this article, we present a novel design, called se-pim, that retrofits Processing-In-Memory (PIM) as a data-intensive confidential computing accelerator. PIM-accelerated computation renders large data computation highly efficient by minimizing data movement. Based on our observation that moving computation closer to memory can achieve efficiency of computation and confidentiality of the processed information simultaneously, we study the advantages of confidential computing inside memory. We construct our findings into a software-hardware co-design called se-pim. Our design illustrates the advantages of PIM-based confidential computing acceleration. We study the challenges in adapting PIM in confidential computing and propose a set of imperative changes, as well as a programming model that can utilize them. Our evaluation shows se-pim can provide a side-channel resistant secure computation offloading and run data-intensive applications with negligible performance overhead compared to the baseline PIM model.},

	abstract = {The semiconductor industry is witnessing a nascent security paradigm shift in the rise of Confidential Computing. Driven by the need to protect computations delegated to co-tenanted machines operated by Cloud Computing services, mainstream instruction set architectures are gradually introducing novel features that can be used to establish protected isolates offering strong integrity and confidentiality guarantees to code and data contained within. Coupled with a Remote Attestation protocol, a third-party may request the launch of an isolate on an otherwise untrusted machine and know—with a high degree of assurance—that a payload of code and data was indeed loaded into a legitimate isolate with a particular configuration.We argue that this ability to reliably establish a safe “beach-head” on an untrusted third-party’s machine has far-reaching consequences with applications beyond protecting workloads delegated to Cloud Computing services. In a future world where facilities for Confidential Computing are widely deployed and used, we imagine a utopia where inadvertent data leakage is a curiosity of a bygone age, with encrypted data moving from isolate to isolate and never resting in plaintext. Moreover, data is only released in explicitly delimited ways for processing, with systems and individuals exhibiting fine-grained control over data.We report on recent activities within Arm in attempting to realize this vision, and hope that this paper acts as a “call to arms” to others to join with us in fully exploring the potential of these emerging technologies.},

If the deep neural network model is deployed on a public cloud platform, the watermarking-based approach does not prevent malicious administrators from stealing the model. We propose a protection method based on the confidential computing, which divides the deep neural network model into a data preprocessing model and a inference model, we use a confidential computing environment to protect the data preprocessing model, and the inference model can be distributed to authorized users for deployment, even if malicious users get the inference model or train student models through knowledge distillation, they cannot obtain the highly accurate results from their models. It is also experimentally demonstrated that the method is also able to resist knowledge migration from the model using fine-tuning training.},

	abstract = {Permissioned blockchain can provide a decentralized, tamper-evident and trusted computing environment and has been widely deployed in e-government, finance and supply chain management. Smart contracts need to be developed using a specific programming language. Limited by the architectural design of blockchain systems, smart contracts still face many challenges in performing complex computing tasks. For example, there are many matrix operations in the inference process of deep neural network models. Loading deep neural network models directly in smart contracts not only requires relatively large development costs, the inference process of deep neural network models generally consumes more computing resources. We use Intel SGX to design a flexible architecture that can outsource complex computing tasks that need to be processed in smart contracts to off-chain computing servers, while being able to use Freivalds’ Algorithm to ensure the correctness of the outsourced computing results.},

We introduce an abstraction layer that makes available the enforcement functionality across different types of nodes whilst hiding the distribution of components and platform specifics.

	abstract = {With its huge real-world demands, large-scale confidential computing still cannot be supported by today’s Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), due to the lack of scalable and effective protection of high-throughput accelerators like GPUs, FPGAs, and TPUs etc. Although attempts have been made recently to extend the CPU-like enclave to GPUs, these solutions require change to the CPU or GPU chips, may introduce new security risks due to the side-channel leaks in CPU-GPU communication and are still under the resource constraint of today’s CPU TEE.To address these problems, we present the first Heterogeneous TEE design that can truly support large-scale compute or data intensive (CDI) computing, without any chip-level change. Our approach, called HETEE, is a device for centralized management of all computing units (e.g., GPUs and other accelerators) of a server rack. It is uniquely designed to work with today’s data centres and clouds, leveraging modern resource pooling technologies to dynamically compartmentalize computing tasks, and enforce strong isolation and reduce TCB through hardware support. More specifically, HETEE utilizes the PCIe ExpressFabric to allocate its accelerators to the server node on the same rack for a non-sensitive CDI task, and move them back into a secure enclave in response to the demand for confidential computing. Our design runs a thin TCB stack for security management on a security controller (SC), while leaving a large set of software (e.g., AI runtime, GPU driver, etc.) to the integrated microservers that operate enclaves. An enclaves is physically isolated from others through hardware and verified by the SC at its inception. Its microserver and computing units are restored to a secure state upon termination.We implemented HETEE on a real hardware system, and evaluated it with popular neural network inference and training tasks. Our evaluations show that HETEE can easily support the CDI tasks on the real-world scale and incurred a maximal throughput overhead of 2.17\% for inference and 0.95\% for training on ResNet152.},

One of the essential reasons for using cloud computing as a means of data protection is that users can easily access relevant data with the proper security protocols. However, various sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, education, manufacturing, etc. have experienced a lot of challenges regarding large and confidential data protection in the past few decades. With the advent of Cloud-computing in recent times, all the issues related to data security and information protection have been easier than before. Researchers have conducted an effective quantitative data collection approach by performing primary analysis through surveys. With a probability sampling technique, researchers have asked around 60 participants from different industrial fields about their opinions regarding the research topic. As per research findings around 60\% of people have supported that cloud computing is essential for maximizing data protection. Around 30\% people agreed with the 24 {\textbackslash}times 7 information monitoring and data encryption challenges can be solved with cloud computing. On the other hand, around 10\% of participants have placed their positive opinion over the error reduction in data protection by using cloud computing. Researchers in this particular research paper are going to explain the importance of using cloud computing as a data security tool. In order to create better data protection systems across various industrial departments, cloud computing can be used in the future research as well.},

	abstract = {Mining large data requires intensive computing resources and data mining expertise, which might be unavailable for many users. With widely available cloud computing resources, data mining tasks can now be moved to the cloud or outsourced to third parties to save costs. In this new paradigm, data and model confidentiality becomes the major concern to the data owner. Data owners have to understand the potential trade-offs among client-side costs, model quality, and confidentiality to justify outsourcing solutions. In this paper, we propose the RASP-Boost framework to address these problems in confidential cloud-based learning. The RASP-Boost approach works with our previous developed RAndom Space Perturbation (RASP) method to protect data confidentiality and uses the boosting framework to overcome the difficulty of learning high-quality classifiers from RASP perturbed data. We develop several cloudclient collaborative boosting algorithms. These algorithms require low client-side computation and communication costs. The client does not need to stay online in the process of learning models. We have thoroughly studied the confidentiality of data, model, and learning process under a practical security model. Experiments on public datasets show that the RASP-Boost approach can provide high-quality classifiers, while preserving high data and model confidentiality and requiring low client-side costs.},

This change has directed users to place their data, whether it is confidential or not, in specific storage known as the cloud. Cloud Computing enables users to save their data in the cloud. When IoT devices started generating large amounts of data, known as Big Data, the cloud couldn’t handle them due to its limited bandwidth and resources, so storing the data was moved to the endpoints of the network replacing cloud computing with edge computing. Edge computing allows users to store the data at the edge of the network. This is a promising technology now as it provides the best features of real-time and parallel processing and content perception. However, just like cloud computing the security of edge computing has risen a lot of concerns. Cloud security and Edge security have the most crucial concepts that gather data to process. Several security frameworks for cloud and edge computing have been discussed and invented. In our paper, we discuss the different challenges and solutions to said frameworks. We also compare the old and new frameworks of security according to their security encryption methods, confidentiality handling of data, and splitting of data through the packets.},

Many of the devices which uses cloud computing are mobile these days. Here data security and privacy became the major issues in this contest. A secure data access control mechanism must be provided before cloud users as most of the users have to outsource sensitive data to the cloud for storage. In recent days many of the MNCs and other famous organization uses the cloud services for data sharing, data storage, data manipulation etc. As there are lots of confidential corporate data being shared on cloud servers, it is very important to provide an efficient encryption system to encrypt outsourced data with a fine-grained access control. In the cloud environment encryption can be the best option to secure data out there and such data can be either Private data or Public data. The public data can be shared among trusted clients that provide an open environment to connect with organization or with the data owner. Private data is client's confidential data and it need more security and privacy so the data must be transferred in encrypted form. In this paper we can see the different encryption techniques and its variants which are currently being used also the possible future works which can be improvised to develop a better security and privacy oriented encryption techniques is discussed.},

	abstract = {Money laundering not only facilitates the perpetration of dangerous and illegal activities it also damages the credibility and integrity of the global financial system and the financial institutions through whom money is laundered. Despite most financial institutions adhering to prevailing laws and regulations designed to prevent the practice of money laundering, it has been difficult to stop illicit activity using conventional methods. Hence, to combat money laundering, financial institutions are increasingly focused on the adoption of new technologies involving the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). One barrier to adoption of these new techniques for anti-money laundering (AML), however, is the need to maintain the confidentiality of the massive quantities of data required to train AI models, a financial data is the subject of regulatory controls and a target for cyber threat actors. In response to these challenges, this paper presents a secure and scalable architecture for AI implementation that uses confidential computing technology to provide complete end-to-end protection of sensitive financial data and the intellectual property of AML algorithm developers. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are demonstrated using cloud infrastructure secured using Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX). The reported solution architecture can be adapted to support federated machine learning (FML), at scale, between mutually distrusting institutions, with independent control of data security at rest, in transit, and in use by individual data owners.},

The proposed inner-product range proof converts a range proof relation into an inner-product form, which can further reduce the range proof size with the vector compression technique. Based on these two techniques, SymmeProof can eventually achieve a {\textbackslash}log (n)log(n)-size range proof. The proposed SymmeProof can be used in many important applications such as blockchain confidential transactions as well as arguments for arithmetic circuit satisfiability. We evaluate the performance of SymmeProof. The results show that SymmeProof substantially outperforms representative methods such as Bulletproofs in the proof size without a trusted setup.},

Cloud Computing is the important buzzword in the today's world of Computer. Cloud is an International Collection of Hardware and Software from hundreds of thousands of private and public computer network. Cloud is global platform that permits digital information to be shared and distributed at very less cost and very fast to use. With the rise of popularity, opportunities and its public connectivity via the Internet it is the next leading edge for trojan, viruses, worms, hackers and cyber-terrorists to start probing and attacking. Viruses, worms, hackers and cyber attacks will enlarge because organized criminals, terrorist and hostile nations would see this as a new frontier to try to steal confidential information, interrupt services and route damage to the enterprise cloud computing network. This paper will discussed the different attacks like Web Security Attack, Browser Security Attack, Cloud Malware Injection Attack, Flooding Attack and their countermeasure.},

For a single potential eavesdropper (PE) case, we derive an optimal power allocation for confidential message and jamming signal to maximize an expected secrecy rate with respect to the trust degree. In order to further increase the expected secrecy rate, by exploiting relaying transmission via PE, we derive the optimal transmission strategy and corresponding power allocation based on the threshold of trust degree. Furthermore, to investigate the effect of the accuracy of trust degree, we analyze the expected secrecy rate loss caused by an estimation error of the trust degree and provide the robust power allocation based on imperfect trust degree. Finally, we extend the results to the case of confidential communication in the presence of multiple PEs. Our analytical and numerical results show that the proposed strategies achieve substantially higher secrecy rates than that without exploiting the trust degree of users.},

	abstract = {There are problems in which the use of linear regression is not sufficiently justified. In these cases, fuzzy linear regression can be used as a modeling tool. The problem of constructing a fuzzy linear regression can usually be reduced to a linear programming problem. One of the features of the resulting linear programming problem is that it uses a relatively large number of constraints in the form of inequalities with a relatively small number of variables. It is known that the problem of constructing a fuzzy linear regression is reduced to the problem of linear programming. If the user does not have enough computing power the resulting problem can be transferred to the cloud server. Two approaches are used for the confidential transfer of the problem to the server: the approach based on cryptographic encryption, and the transformational approach. The paper describes a protocol based on the transformational approach that allows for secure outsourcing of fuzzy linear regression.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing technology is playing a vital role in this fast internet era for transferring, storing and accessing the large volume of confidential data which are official, medical and military. Efficient techniques for searching and processing the cloud data are essential for providing better service to the cloud users. For the fast processing and searching the data, many techniques were proposed by various researchers in the past. However, those techniques are not working in better results in cloud services. In a heterogeneous environment, achieving higher efficiency is an important issue in task scheduling. To solve this problem, many evolutionary algorithms have been adopted in the past. Even though it is a Nondeterministic Polynomial-hard problem, the local search algorithms are integrated for increasing convergence speed in population-based algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new task scheduling approach which combines an incremental particle swarm optimization and A * search algorithm for effective task scheduling. Moreover, the current particle swarm optimization algorithms and the heuristic algorithms gained in results on random and scientific Directed Acyclic Graph. The experiments show that the performance of the proposed approach is better when it is compared with the existing task scheduling approaches.},

However, how to protect customers confidential data processed and generated during the computation is becoming the major security concern. Focusing on engineering computing and optimization tasks, this paper investigates secure outsourcing of widely applicable linear programming (LP) computations. Our mechanism design explicitly decomposes LP computation outsourcing into public LP solvers running on the cloud and private LP parameters owned by the customer. The resulting flexibility allows us to explore appropriate security/efficiency tradeoff via higher-level abstraction of LP computation than the general circuit representation. Specifically, by formulating private LP problem as a set of matrices/vectors, we develop efficient privacy-preserving problem transformation techniques, which allow customers to transform the original LP into some random one while protecting sensitive input/output information. To validate the computation result, we further explore the fundamental duality theorem of LP and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions that correct results must satisfy. Such result verification mechanism is very efficient and incurs close-to-zero additional cost on both cloud server and customers. Extensive security analysis and experiment results show the immediate practicability of our mechanism design.},

However, while new privacy protection techniques keep coming out, how existing ones can best fit development settings is little studied. Suffering from limited architectural support in terms of programming interfaces, state-of-the-art solutions can hardly reach general developers. In this paper, we proposed the CLOAK framework for developing confidential smart contracts. The key capability of Cloak is allowing developers to implement and deploy practical solutions to multi-party transaction (MPT) problems, i.e., transact with secret inputs and states owned by different parties by simply specifying it. To this end, CLOAK introduced a domain-specific annotation language for declaring privacy specifications and further automatically generating confidential smart contracts to be deployed with trusted execution environment (TEE) on blockchain. In our evaluation on both simple and real-world applications, developers managed to deploy business services on blockchain in a concise manner by only developing CLOAK smart contracts whose size is less than 30\% of the deployed ones.},

Indeed, the security of such a system is the greatest concern of computer scientists, providers of cloud and organizations who want to adopt and benefit from these services. Cloud computing providers must implement concepts ensuring network security, hardware, data storage and strategies of control and access to services. All these elements help to preserve data security and ensuring the availability of services associated with the Cloud, to better satisfy clients and acquire and build their trust. However, even if the data storage security in cloud servers is assured, reluctance remain when it comes to process the confidential data. Indeed, the fear that sensitive data is being used is a major obstacle in the adoption of cloud services by enterprises. To overcome this obstacle, the use of methods that can perform operations on encrypted data without knowing the secret key, seems to be an effective way to strengthen the confidentiality of information.

It provides on-demand service, broad network access, elasticity etc. But the usability of these characteristic get obstructed by many security challenges. As the cloud service user uploads their confidential data over the cloud platform, it must be transmitted in a secure way. For this, it should be transmitted through a protected communication channel. A practical solution to this is a Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. It is used to exchange the cryptographical keys securely over the public channel. In this paper, the extended version of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm is suggested which can prevent the system against Mim attack and plain-text attack. This algorithm is oriented towards removing the extended version of Diffie-Hellman algorithm. It uses one model based on arbitrary numbers and logarithms. This is considered to provide security improvement to the communication channel and also countermeasure the attack. Also, a cloud based model is presented for engineering educational domain. Above algorithm is used in this architecture to provide more security to the user data. This architecture attains various security parameters such as confidentiality, data integrity and individualization.},

	abstract = {Cloud Computing is a modern paradigm that can facilitate organizations to share several transaction services in a more secure way. The cloud system is infected with a lot of security issues and threats over transactional process which could outlaw the entire system. Cryptographic techniques using DNA structure are being utilized on a large scale for transmitting transactional data secretly, with DNA as an informational and computational carrier. To design a technique on transaction database systems, Watson-crick Hoogsteen base Confidential Data Transaction (WHO-CDT) mechanism is used in cloud infrastructure. WHO-CDT mechanism employs transactional information storage, in a more ultra-compact form using the DNA confidentiality structure form. The DNA confidentiality structure converts the user provided transactional data into the binary storage data. The binary data storage of information used in WHO-CDT is next encoded using the thick oligonucleotide sequences. This sequence of encoded data improves the confidentiality level on the OLTP system and business analytics. In the DNA structure, WHO-CDT follows one-time component pad encode method for different types of transactional data. Finally, WHO-CDT follows a series of user transaction with high confidentiality using the Polymerase Chain Action procedure. The series of DNA based security level maintenance to the cloud infrastructure attain the best solution with limited cost factor. Experimental studies show that the DNA-based Information Storage algorithms achieve good performance in terms of data confidentiality, execution time and communication overhead for encoding and decoding.},

Cloud computing has advanced with the emergence of edge computing. Its primary strength is its ability to move delicate information from the cloud to the edge while improving organization security, empowering high-recurrence correspondence, and empowering continuous information move. The edge computing network faces a number of serious security challenges as a result of the storage of confidential and sensitive data on edge servers. Since the information produced by IoT gadgets is parted into a few pieces and put away in different edge servers that are scattered across different areas, it is trying to guarantee information trustworthiness because of information misfortune and mistaken information capacity in edge servers. With the ascent of edge figuring, there are different security and information trustworthiness gives that blockchain innovation can address. We give an exhaustive assessment of edge processing in blend with blockchain innovation in this article. We start by presenting the models for blockchain and edge figuring. The objectives and plan of edge processing with combination of blockchain are then covered. The third concentrate on the blend of edge figuring and blockchain is advertised. The exploration issues are at last investigated.},

As we know Cloud Computing has many attractive features that can be used to store their confidential data with many organizations. Due to the technology of collecting virtual machines, this technique has only used computers. Cloud computing is an important technique for parallel computing along with distributed computing. Cloud computing provides various features like shared resources, software packages, information, storage and many different applications, based on the user's demand worldwide. It provides a comprehensive solution for computing and storage. By increasing the popularity of cloud computing; to protect the confidential data, it has been challenging to handle service requests, to run feedback threads on a real-time basis. Therefore, in short, we can say that rapid use of technology has led to some performance such as performance, fault tolerance, data redundancy, data loss etc. Cloud Technology is one of the key issues in today's performance analysis in which the user does not access information from cloud storage at the mean time due to load balancing. Therefore, one of the factors of performance analysis is load balancing which is responsible for the time of request and response in cloud computing technology and by improving the load balancing factor, we can improve the performance analysis of this technique.},

While cloud-computing is offering many advantages over the on-premises computing conditions in multiple aspects, like accessibility, availability, cost-efficiency, and scalability, it also introduces a wide range of new difficulties related to security. Previous research have shown that there are security threats in almost every component of cloud computing architecture such as infrastructure, storage, and application. The attacker has a clear set of targets that are interrelated to the Virtual Machines. He extracts confidential information from the user by implementing their own attack procedures of Virtual Machine on the physical servers. The Cloud platform provides underlaying infrastructure to the middle layer of the software system to the application that are developed on the top of the systems. This paper majorly concentrates on a specific task that is related to cache-based side channel attacks which targets the virtualization level, from the bottom of the software stack to the top.

The security of confidential data is one of the primary concerns in fog computing. As a result, achieving a reliable level of security in the fog computing environment is crucial. In this context, 3D point and mesh fog data are becoming increasingly popular among the various types of data stored in the fog. Data encryption using chaotic behavior is one of the preferred research areas due to its unique properties, such as randomness, determinism, sensitivity to initial conditions, and ergodicity. In this paper, we have taken advantage of this chaotic behavior to achieve higher security. This study presents a novel approach for protecting the privacy of 3D point and mesh fog data. Initially, the fog data coordinates are transformed using the sequence generated by the chaotic behavior. Then, bifurcation analysis is used to depict the enhanced scope of the proposed map. The quality of the proposed chaotic system is assessed using metrics such as the Lyapunov exponent and approximate entropy. Results show that the proposed encryption framework performs superior when subjected to brute-force and statistical attacks. Further, the designed framework produces better results than the prior literature.},

	doi = {10.1109/CLOUD60044.2023.00039},
	abstract = {With the growing popularity of containers running in cloud environments, one might believe techniques like virtual machines (VMs) and nested virtualization are no longer essential for cloud computing, but this is not true. First, they are foundational for the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) base that most clouds use for their Kubernetes (K8s) offerings - nodes are deployed in VMs instead of on bare-metal machines to improve flexibility and resource utilization. Second, state-of-theart technology like Kata Containers or KubeVirt deploys VMs inside K8s, to improve container isolation or to offer a cloudnative way to deploy VMs. When such techniques are coupled with VM-based K8s worker node deployments, this requires the use of nested virtualization. However, nested virtualization introduces a larger trusted computing base (TCB) and therefore raises security concerns. In addition, it introduces an important performance overhead and cannot be easily applied to confidential computing, an emerging technology to allow the execution of sensitive workloads in the cloud. In this paper, we propose the secondary-VM (secVM) framework, an alternative to nested virtualization which addresses these challenges by flattening the nested hierarchy, but maintains the resource isolation features of nested virtualization. By removing the emulation layer required for nested virtualization, the secVM framework reduces the TCB, is compatible with any confidential computing techniques, and removes the overhead associated with nested virtualization. Therefore, in reference to the Turtles Project that introduced the concept of nested virtualization in the open-source virtualization technology - Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM), we argue it is time to free the “turtles”.},

In order to leverage a remote cloud based infrastructure, a company essentially gives away private data and information that might be sensitive and confidential. Secret sharing schemes are used to restrict access to such sensitive and confidential data. Threshold secret sharing schemes is a scheme in which the number of the participants in the reconstruction phase is important for recovering the secret. In this paper, aiming at tackling the important issue of identity revocation, we are introducing the outsourcing computation into IBE and suggest a revocable IBE scheme should be added in the server-aided setting. Our proposed scheme delivers most of the key generation related operations i.e. key-issuing and Key update processes are performed by Key Update Cloud Service Provider, leaving only a fixed number of simple operations for PKG and users to perform locally. By utilizing a novel collusion-resistant technique, this goal is achieved: we make use of a hybrid private key for each user, in which an AND gate is drawn in to attach and bound the identity component and the time component. In addition, we propose another technique which is verifiable secure under the recently formulized Refereed Delegation of Computation model. To end with, we provide extensive experimental results to reveal the effectiveness of our proposed construction.},

We provide an achievable secure rate region for this network. The achievability scheme utilizes structured codes for message transmission, cooperative jamming and scaled compute-and-forward. In particular, the sources use nested lattice codes and stochastic encoding, while the destinations jam using lattice points. The relay decodes two integer combinations of the received lattice points and forwards, using Gaussian codewords, to both destinations. The achievability technique provides the insight that we can utilize the untrusted relay node as an encryption block in a two-hop interference relay channel with confidential messages.},

In this paper, we propose a novel privacy preserving keyword search scheme over encrypted cloud data to address this problem. To enable users to search over encrypted data, we firstly adopt a structure named as Inverted Matrix (IM) to build search index. The IM is consisted of a number of index vectors, each of which is associated with a keyword. Then we map a keyword to a value as an address used to locate the corresponding index vector. Finally, we mask index vectors with pseudo-random bits to obtain an Encrypted Enlarged Inverted Matrix (EEIM) to preserve the privacy of users.

These vulnerabilities increase the number of attacks which impact on system security. There is a huge challenge behind the success of cloud computing potential for ensuring the security. The cloud computing involves the process of providing data security that plays an important role in the process of data integrity. The data integrity provides the best security in the field of cloud computing, thereby provides confidentially for more data focusing. This research reviews the cloud services to encrypt the data from the cloud providers using different types of encryption algorithm. This research reviews about the encryption schemes used for data integrity and security and also discuss about the problems faced during the research. Finally, the solutions to overcome the problems is also suggested and thereby concludes a suitable technique which would be used in future study.},

To reduce the storing space and save the bandwidth share the data with others in cloud storage using public-key cryptosystems that produce constant-size cipher texts such that the active delegation of decoding rights for any set of cipher texts but it lead to many privacy problems. To avoid this problem the private and public cloud combine and form a hybrid cloud. In this the confidential data can be stored in private cloud and other data are stored in public cloud. Even though, the exponential growth of ever-increasing volume of data in the cloud has raised many storage challenges. To overcome these challenges we proposed a deduplication technique. It is specialized and resent data compression technique which eliminates redundant data as well as improves the cloud storage and bandwidth utilization. We also present several new deduplication constructions which are supporting authorized duplicate check in hybrid cloud architecture. To protect the confidentiality of sensitive data, whereas supporting deduplication, the convergent encryption technique has been proposed to encrypt the data before outsourcing. To provide the highest data security, this paper makes the first attempt to formally address the problem of authorized data deduplication. We also proposed many new deduplication constructions supporting authorized duplicate check in hybrid cloud architecture, which incurs nominal overhead compared to conventional operation.},

The process involves hiding a secret image in a cover image and then transferring it over the internet. This method can use multimedia such as text, images, audio files, and video files. Here, steganography is developed to hide a location of an area (ex in form of a map) in a cover image and transfer the image through the internet. The performance of this technique has been analyzed through MSE and PSNR values for its utility in security-based applications.},

	abstract = {With the popularity of cloud computing and machine learning, it has been a trend to outsource machine learning processes (including model training and model-based inference) to cloud. By the outsourcing, other than utilizing the extensive and scalable resource offered by the cloud service provider, it will also be attractive to users if the cloud servers can manage the machine learning processes autonomously on behalf of the users. Such a feature will be especially salient when the machine learning is expected to be a long-term continuous process and the users are not always available to participate. Due to security and privacy concerns, it is also desired that the autonomous learning preserves the confidentiality of users' data and models involved. Hence, in this paper, we aim to design a scheme that enables autonomous and confidential model refining in cloud. Homomor-phic encryption and trusted execution environment technology can protect confidentiality for autonomous computation, but each of them has their limitations respectively and they are complementary to each other. Therefore, we further propose to integrate these two techniques in the design of the model refining scheme. Through implementation and experiments, we evaluate the feasibility of our proposed scheme. The results indicate that, with our proposed scheme the cloud server can autonomously re-fine an encrypted model with newly provided encrypted training data to continuously improve its accuracy. Though the efficiency is still significantly lower than the baseline scheme that refines plaintext-model with plaintext-data, we expect that it can be improved by fully utilizing the higher level of parallelism and the computational power of GPU at the cloud server.},

Thus, mobile devices teamed up in groups to share their resources among one another which are majorly Web Services, Storage and Computing resources. However, potential participants in AMC often feel a level of insecurity as they envisaged loss of control over various personal and confidential data in their mobile devices which can occur in the course of sharing of resources. Therefore, AMC as a service provisioning paradigm for mobile device users has a need for an implementation of a trust management system to serve as a protection and guarantee of confidence for intended AMC participants. This study proposed a Multi-Criteria Trust Management system (MCTM) architecture for AMC to protect the interest of various participating mobile devices. This system provides an avenue to identify trustworthy mobile devices to whom they can carry out resource sharing and as well alert or notify them of any malicious act that could have happened. We carried out a simple evaluation procedure with a number of incorrect service matches in the course of responding to a query as well as comparing the level of precision attained by the proposed architecture with already existing research. The proposed system proves to give a maximum confidence to mobile users to show high interest in participating in the AMC system.},

	abstract = {During Recent days, huge importance is given to Reversible Data Hiding(RDH) techniques in images, since it assures the excellent feature of retrieving the original cover image information in a lossless manner after embedded secret information is extracted, while protecting the image contents confidentiality. This paper proposes a lossless data hiding scheme for color cover images with very important and confidential information content. This proposed method, exploits least computational complexity by using histogram shifting technique to hide secret bits in confused color cover image, where confusion in cover image is created by using Quad tree decomposition. There are number of data hiding techniques proposed to embed data like LSB, Discrete Cosine Transformation, Pixel value differencing, Discrete Fourier Transform etc into images. But the above mentioned techniques suffer from many limitations like less data hiding capacity, degradation in the quality of image and very less security for the secret information hidden. To have control over these limitations, this paper proposes an enhanced histogram shifting method for color images by embedding the secret information into three different planes of RGB image in such a way that, it not only improves the quality of image and also achieves high embedding capacity. The PSNR value of the proposed technique is better than previous data hiding methods. This scheme has been implemented for images of various sizes and a comparative study in terms of PSNR, MSE, Embedded Rate and Correlation factor is presented. The same methodology could be applied even for DICOM(Medical) color images.},

A major challenge, however, remains in that the highly confidential grid data is susceptible for potential cyberattacks when outsourced to the cloud. In this paper, a security and cloud outsourcing framework is developed for the economic dispatch (ED) linear programming application. The security framework transforms the ED linear program into a confidentiality-preserving linear program, that masks both the data and problem structure, thus enabling secure outsourcing to the cloud. Results show that for large grid test cases the performance gain and costs outperforms the in-house infrastructure.},

The method makes the Fog servers to store one secret key per user and the user performs hash-based encryptions/decryptions. The proposed system is supported by Blockchain technique to achieve data integrity when confidential data are transferred between edge devices and nodes. The transactions between the nodes are recorded in the blocks which are hashed so that all edge and fog nodes are encircled by a secured system. Whenever any malicious edge server enters the network, it is identified based on ledger maintained at the nodes.

One of the authentication techniques is a textual password based. This type of textual password commonly follows an encryption algorithm to provide security.

When users choose meaningful words from dictionaries, by using brute force attacks, it makes textual passwords vulnerable to dictionary and easy to break. To overcome the drawbacks, a new authenticate technique is proposed in this paper in order to provide for more security authentication system. In this paper the textual password will be hidden in an image using steganography technique. All data and critical information like passwords are stored in encrypted manner used image as carrier so it's difficult for brute force attack to crack it. Steganography is used to hide secret information onside some carrier. The most basic and important image steganography technique is Least Significant Bit (LSB) embedding technique. In this technique, data can be hidden in the least significant bits of the cover image and the human eye would be unable to notice the hidden image in the cover file. LSB steganography is combined with AES cryptography to hide textual password, in order to provide high level security on authentication system that run under Android.},

It is very obvious that cloud computing servers are highly protected against unauthorized access, but in some cases these files stored can be accessible by the maintenance staffs. Fully protection is needed to ensure that the files stored in the server are only accessible to owners. This paper proposes a system that will employ Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) combination encryption process using USB device. The files may be accessed in the cloud but all the files will remain encrypted till the USB device is plugged into the computer. The point of applying such method is to fully protect the files and avoid using one single password. The randomly generated passkeys are very complex combinations thus user will not be able to fully memorize them. The proposed system will detect the USB that contains the private-key used for the files to be downloaded from the cloud.},

But storing secure and confidential data on cloud introduces many security risks, namely data leakage, data theft and reduced control on data. In order to maintain confidentiality, the data is encrypted before outsourcing it to cloud. But this introduces the problem of efficient searching on the cloud. Several approaches exist for searching on this encrypted data stored on cloud but require large number of comparisons and time to search the desired documents. In this paper, we propose a cluster based privacy preserving multi-keyword search scheme over encrypted cloud data. The proposed search scheme retains the security requirements as proposed in the existing approaches in literature but provides results efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed search scheme as it reduces the number of comparisons required to search the desired document by 80\% for dataset with 6000 documents. Also, the time required to search the desired documents is also reduced by 70\% for the same dataset as compared to the existing efficient search schemes in literature.},

But, it also faces with some problems about security and privacy concerns. In order to enhance image security and privacy over cloud computing environment, we put forward an algorithm by using secret sharing technique to camouflage the existence of confidential images. The proposed scheme first decomposes a secret RGB color image and transforms it into Y, Cb, Cr channels. Then, several cover images are chosen and used to create meaningful shares. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can yield satisfactory qualities for the meaningful shares and the reconstructed images. Moreover, the proposed scheme has the advantages of simple computation and image privacy.},

Simulation results show that CPM sequence behaves much better BER performance especially in the case of large number of users. Besides, it shows superior performance in time varying acoustic channels. Hence, the proposed chaos-based DS-CDMA system has potential applications in confidential underwater networks.},

Collaborative sharing and analysis of Cyber Threat Information (CTI) can greatly improve the prediction and prevention of cyber-attacks. However, CTI data containing sensitive and confidential information can cause privacy exposure and disclose security risks, which will deter organisations from sharing their CTI data. To address these concerns, the consortium of the EU H2020 project entitled Collaborative and Confidential Information Sharing and Analysis for Cyber Protection (C3ISP) has designed and implemented a framework (i.e. C3ISP Framework) as a service for cyber threat management. This paper focuses on the design and development of an API Gateway, which provides a bridge between end-users and their data sources, and the C3ISP Framework. It facilitates end-users to retrieve their CTI data, regulate data sharing agreements in order to sanitise the data, share the data with privacy-preserving means, and invoke collaborative analysis for attack prediction and prevention. In this paper, we report on the implementation of the API Gateway and experiments performed. The results of these experiments show the efficiency of our gateway design, and the benefits for the end-users who use it to access the C3ISP Framework.},

The cloud era has a huge number of services, through providers like Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, and many other Cloud Service Providers (CSP). Since most businesses are currently adopting cloud computing in some capacity, cloud security is essential. Because of the security, governance, and compliance concerns associated with storing material in the cloud, information, and communication technologies (IT) professionals are still wary of transferring more data and applications there. They fear that cyberattacks or inadvertent releases of highly confidential corporate data and intellectual property could expose them.

By remapping plugin enclaves, an enclave allows in-situ processing to avoid expensive data movement in a function chain.

In this paper, we aim to achieve a better trade-off among the level of protection for outsourced DNN model training, the expenses, and the utility of data, using novel image disguising mechanisms. We design a suite of image disguising methods that are efficient to implement and then analyze them to understand multiple levels of tradeoffs between data utility and protection of confidentiality. The experimental evaluation shows the surprising ability of DNN modeling methods in discovering patterns in disguised images and the flexibility of these image disguising mechanisms in achieving different levels of resilience to attacks.},

As such, applications can excessively obtain confidential information, such as vehicle location and owner preferences and even upload it to the cloud, threatening the security of the vehicle and the privacy of the owner. In this study, we propose a fine-grained access control scheme to restrict applications' access to data in CAVs (FGAC-inCAVs). First, we present a system model composed of the following elements: a trusted third party (TTP), which is a fully trusted authority; perception components like sensors, which can capture the road information (pictures, videos, etc.); and multiple applications. Then, a fast attribute-based encryption (ABE) is presented, and security analysis also shows it is secure against selective and chosen-plaintext attacks. Furthermore, we propose a key update scheme based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency.},

Sharing of data is an important functionality in cloud storage. In cloud computing environment data sharing and transfer has increased exponentially. Security, integrity, non-repudiation, confidentiality, and authentication services are the most important factors in data-security. Maintaining Confidentiality and Security for critical data are highly challenging, especially when these data are stored in memory or send through the communication networks. The confidential data are embedded steganography. Data encryption technique tries to convert data to another data that is hard to understand. In this paper, a crypto-stego methodology has been proposed where image steganography and a new method of cryptographic technique is used. The steganographic technique embedded confidential data using Pixel Mapping Method (PMM), but in a chaotic sequence generated by chaotic map technique. The encryption and decryption uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) which is used to produce a cryptographic method with the help of the powerful features of the Crossover and Mutation operations of GA. Both the encryption and steganography process use secret session key which are generated using the combination of some universal feature of cover image and the users user's secret key.},

As we know, we now have billions of applications, many of which attract a large number of malicious applications that can monitor mobile phone users and discover a lot of their sensitive and confidential information. This research proposes a minor modification in the design of the software and hardware of smart phones, to ensure stronger protection for the user from any malicious application, even from the manufacturer of the device. The idea is based on building a physical lockout mechanism for some of the sensored devices, such as the camera and microphone, in addition to relaying alerts, and forcing user to accept requests before accessing any information. Acceptance of user requests is forced by overriding predefined permissions, which are usually difficult to track and manage. The research also provides an overview of a specialized platform which can easily assess the credibility of applications which exhibit strange behavior. We provide the details of the method, with simulation, for realising the suggested ideas into practice.

The aim of this project is to develop a new hybrid algorithm combining the benefits of AES, RSA and Polybius square cipher algorithms to improve the execution speed, improve security and transfer the secret key in a secured manner. This algorithm uses CFB mode instead of CBC mode for encryption to produce a unique output. The key of AES algorithm is now encrypted using RSA algorithm, but RSA only accepts numeric values. Using Polybius square cipher algorithm, the key value gets converted into numeric value. The key exchange algorithm will help us to prevent the attacks made to disclose the key which is transferred between client and receiver.

Some of the workers may be stragglers, e.g., slow or busy. We are interested in reducing the delays experienced by the Master. We focus on linear computations as an essential operation in many iterative algorithms. We propose a solution based on new codes, called Staircase codes, introduced previously by two of the authors. Staircase codes allow flexibility in the number of stragglers up to a given maximum, and universally achieve the information theoretic limit on the download cost by the Master, leading to latency reduction. We find upper and lower bounds on the Master's mean waiting time. We derive the distribution of the Master's waiting time, and its mean, for systems with up to two stragglers. We show that Staircase codes always outperform existing solutions based on classical secret sharing codes. We validate our results with extensive implementation on Amazon EC2.},

	abstract = {Technology becomes more and more advanced everyday, both from the software and from the hardware perspective. Brand new devices, more powerful and capable of the generation preceding them, are steadily released. Everybody owns laptops, smartphones and many other devices with great compute capabilities, able to easily solve problems a few years ago considered almost impossible. These devices are, however, most of the time underused, resulting in an incredible waste of computational resources. The needs of professional people and scientists are evolving too, alongside the advances of technology. In many fields, from financial and biomedical simulation to insurance predictions, from 3D rendering to mathematical computations etc huge compute capabilities are still required. Despite the always growing presence of powerful devices and their increasingly cheap prices, in many situations using only our own devices is not enough. The contrast between underused devices and needs of computational resources led to the birth of a new approach: volunteer computing. This approach brings a user to be part of a network, sharing his idle CPU (or GPU) cycles in order to solve a subtask of a problem thus contributing, along with many other users, to the solution of a bigger task. In a very large number of cases, however, volunteer computing needs to tackle some serious security concerns. Many tasks, in fact, deal with sensitive information whose disclosure, even in a minimal part, must be avoided. For this reason still many problems are usually not handled by collaborative networks, since it is not possible, in many cases, to hide confidential data from inputs of every subtask. In this paper we present a way to solve the problem described. Through the use of trusted computing we are able to manage complex problems in a distributed network of volunteer computing devices without the risks related to the spread of sensitive data.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, there has been a constant increase in the accessibility and utility of the Internet. More number of people are tending towards the use of mobile applications, E-mails, E-commerce and social networking sites. In this scenario, even the most confidential information travels through unsecured channels. Hence, it becomes crucial to ensure the security of the data being exchanged. This paper explores an efficient method of secure data transmission through information hiding which includes text steganography and cryptography. The proposed methodology was built on top of the result of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a symmetric key algorithm used for cryptography. The concept of data hiding is realized using text steganography i.e. a secret message is concealed within another text. The text used to hide the sensitive information was constructed dynamically and did not reveal the presence of any secret data. It can be concluded that the combination of these two cryptographic techniques provides an efficient solution for information hiding and data transmission through unsecured channels.},

Keeping in mind the eventually goal is to accomplish reasonable effectiveness, our system configuration unequivocally separate the Linear Programming (LP) computation outsourcing into open LP solvers functioning on the cloud as well as private LP parameters possessed by the client. The subsequent adaptability permits us to observe fitting security tradeoff by means of larger amount deliberation LP calculations than the general circuit representation.

To reduce the likelihood of it, cloud computing uses homomorphic encryption. However, a homomorphic cipher only allows adding and multiplying encrypted numbers; in some cases, a division operation is required to implement algorithms. To implement the division operation with encrypted numbers it is necessary to implement the encrypted number comparison operation. Considering that the operation of comparing encrypted numbers is carried out using numerical methods, it is necessary to adapt the existing algorithms for Euclidean division. In this article, we propose a two-stage algorithm for Euclidean division of numbers encrypted using the CKKS scheme and investigate its properties.},

Cloud computing is a service provided for user to store and process their data online instead of local device. Mobile Cloud computing which is an extension of the cloud computing service allows user to remotely access their data and services that are being uploaded to the cloud beforehand in any place and any time as long as they have internet connection in their personal mobile device. Throughout the period of the mobile cloud computing era, the security has always been a concern and post as a formidable challenge even for experienced security specialist. Moreover, encryption method such as RSA and Diffie Hellman cryptosystem proven to be useless against the attacks launched by quantum computer. Hence, Homomorphic Signature scheme is introduced along with the Identity Management (IDM) server into the mobile cloud computing in order to address this issue by applying implicit authentication method to differentiate between the genuine and non-genuine user which allows system to authenticate the clients accurately. The details of the framework will be further explained later in this paper, where the user will be authenticated with IDM as medium and no password is used throughout the authentication process, allowing the client to be safely authenticated at the end of the process.},

	abstract = {Credit card fraud events take place frequently and then result in huge financial losses [1]. The number of online transactions has grown in large quantities and online credit card transactions holds a huge share of these transactions. Therefore, banks and financial institutions offer credit card fraud detection applications much value and demand. Fraudulent transactions can occur in various ways and can be put into different categories. This paper focuses on four main fraud occasions in real-world transactions. Each fraud is addressed using a series of machine learning models and the best method is selected via an evaluation. This evaluation provides a comprehensive guide to selecting an optimal algorithm with respect to the type of the frauds and we illustrate the evaluation with an appropriate performance measure. Another major key area that we address in our project is real-time credit card fraud detection. For this, we take the use of predictive analytics done by the implemented machine learning models and an API module to decide if a particular transaction is genuine or fraudulent. We also assess a novel strategy that effectively addresses the skewed distribution of data. The data used in our experiments come from a financial institution according to a confidential disclosure agreement.},

Cloud providers have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure their users' data remains confidential and secure. Though there are some ongoing efforts on developing cloud security standards, most cloud providers are implementing a mish-mash of security and privacy controls. This has led to confusion among cloud consumers as to what security measures they should expect from the cloud services, and whether these measures would comply with their security and compliance requirements. We have conducted a comprehensive study to review the potential threats faced by cloud consumers and have determined the compliance models and security controls that should be in place to manage the risk. Based on this study, we have developed an ontology describing the cloud security controls, threats and compliances. We have also developed an application that classifies the security threats faced by cloud users and automatically determines the high level security and compliance policy controls that have to be activated for each threat. The application also displays existing cloud providers that support these security policies. Cloud consumers can use our system to formulate their security policies and find compliant providers even if they are not familiar with the underlying technology.},

Owing to broadcast nature of wireless channels, confidential messages without proper security protection in ICVs may be easily exposed to malicious users. In this paper, a mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) based mobile crowd computing framework for ICV networks is proposed, where multiple vehicles act as workers to provide computing services for end user (EU). In particular, artificial noise (AN) assisted physical (PHY) layer security approaches are used to enhance the security in offloading links. Ergodic secrecy rates in different offloading phases in time-varying channels are derived. In addition, an incentive-driven mechanism is introduced to encourage workers to share their idle computing resources, and an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the overall price paid for computing tasks, subject to energy consumption and delay constraints. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations verify the analysis on the ergodic secrecy rates.},

However, energy and computing capabilities of mobile devices and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) are restricted. Ensuring the confidentiality of the information stored in the Mobile Edge Server is the most prominent issue with Mobile Edge Computing. Previous works concentrated on resource allocation algorithms rather than assuring the security of MEC servers and end devices. Authors do not propose a solution to reduce threats such as malicious insiders, access management and leaking of confidential data. In this paper, we propose a flexible and adaptive approach for ensuring the security of resources stored on the MEC server by establishing a secure link between IoT devices and IoT Gateway. We simulate a Threat model and perform various threats to validate security requirements such as restricting access to the server by using Origin Access Identity, encrypting data at rest, enabling logs and enabling automated backup. We further validate the proposed Power-Aware VM allocation policy. We show that our model consumes 6.43\% lesser energy compared to existing VM allocation policies.},

Docker relies on union-capable file systems, where any action performed to a base image is captured as a new file system layer. This strategy allows developers to easily pack applications into Docker image layers and distribute them via public registries. However, this image creation and distribution strategy does not protect sensitive data from malicious privileged users (e.g., registry administrator, cloud provider), since encryption is not natively supported. We propose and demonstrate a mechanism for secure Docker image manipulation throughout its life cycle: The creation, storage and usage of a Docker image is backed by a data-at-rest mechanism, which maintains sensitive data encrypted on disk and encrypts/decrypts them on-the-fly in order to preserve their confidentiality at all times, while the distribution and migration of images is enhanced with a mechanism that encrypts only specific layers of the file system that need to remain confidential and ensures that only legitimate key holders can decrypt them and reconstruct the original image. Through a rich interaction with our system the audience will experience first-hand how sensitive image data can be safely distributed and remain encrypted at the storage device throughout the container's lifetime, bearing only a marginal performance overhead.},

	abstract = {With the popularity of cloud computing, cloud storage, as a part of cloud computing services, has also attracted extensive attention because of its flexibility and low-cost economic expenditure. On the basis of searchable access, this paper combines blockchain with searchable access, and proposes a dynamic verifiable ciphertext retrieval scheme based on blockchain. This scheme is mainly applied to the private cloud environment that needs to ensure the absolute security of data, such as the database of confidential institutions. Through the characteristics of Ethereum account, authorized access control in one to many environment can be realized. Relying on the characteristics of Ethereum, it solves the problem of the correctness of the results returned by the malicious server. And aiming at the problem that the ECS does not update data, this scheme innovatively solves the verification of the returned results during data update by introducing the aggregated message authentication code technology. The scheme also supports forward and backward security to ensure that no privacy will be disclosed during data update. At the same time, experimental tests are carried out on the three aspects of index generation, retrieval and verification. The test results show that the scheme has high efficiency.},

Furthermore, the contradiction between massive data transmission and limited communication resources promotes an urgent need for a proper scheme to improve resource utilization. In this paper, we design a joint secure offloading and resource allocation (SoRA) scheme based on PLS technology and spectrum sharing architecture. We aim at minimizing the system processing delay of all vehicular users (VUs) while ensuring the security of information, by jointly optimizing the spectrum access, transmit power and computing resource allocation. Then we adopt a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the optimization problem. With proper training, we demonstrate that the VU agents can successfully cooperate to improve the system processing delay and ensure the security of the offloading process.},

	abstract = {The Cloud Computing is a self-motivated term, which gives argument free information outsourcing service, which keep the client from burdens of nearby storage issues. Presently, cloud computing is utilized in numerous areas like military, hospitals, industry, colleges and so on to putting away huge amount of data or information. On request of client, the data or information can be accessed from cloud. Generally, Information can be classified as personal, public, and confidential and all the information is in cloud are stored in someone else’s infrastructure. It is always very difficult to trust on third party cloud providers for confidential and personal data. Even the Big players of cloud industry say that security is the responsibility of both company as well as of their client. Therefore, from the client perspective, when the information is stored on cloud then it should be crypted well so that no other user can be able to read it if they get anyhow access to it. When information stored on cloud it faces so many issues like security of data. For these issues many algorithms designed. However, utilization of one calculation or algorithm is not successful for significant phase of security in cloud. In this research work, with the help of cryptographic algorithms the security issues are reduced. Proposed system improves the security in cloud storage framework using different encryption algorithm like AES algorithm with S- box and Feistel Algorithm. The structure utilizes the information-transferring, cutting, ordering, encryption, merging, unscrambling and recovery cycle to make sure about the enormous information put away in the multi cloud. Cryptographic algorithm is mostly used for sending data over a network in a secure manner and to store data in system in non-human readable form. In addition, cloud computing is a combination of Network, Server, and Storage at Infrastructure level. Therefore, this research work is proposed using cryptographic algorithm to store data in secure manner on cloud.},

	abstract = {Threats to data processing in the cloud computing environment are increasing with emerging cloud applications. Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) implements a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) through hardware-based isolation, which can enhance the security of cloud applications by providing a separate secure space that does not reveal its interior. A trusted memory area isolated by SGX, so-called enclave, protects the confidential code and data from any other software, including highly privileged system software. However, the adversary also benefits from isolation by inserting malicious code into the enclave where the system cannot detect it. Existing studies suggest various measures to deal with enclave malware, but these are based on an underlying assumption that the system must be trusted, which does not apply to the semi-honest cloud platform. To this end, we propose a novel method, named Interclave, that protects the system from enclave malware in the cloud computing environment without trusting any component other than the intermediate enclave. Interclave forces every ECALL and OCALL of a suspicious enclave to be executed through an intermediate enclave. This prevents the malicious behavior of enclave malware such as code-reuse attacks that modify the stack or register values associated with the program's execution address. Interclave stores and restores all stack and register values before and after the execution of the suspicious enclave, ensuring the integrity of these values. Our implementation is done with slight code modifications which occupy only a little storage capacity without complicated hardware changes.},

However, outsourced data transfer becomes a critical requirement for users to shift their cloud storage providers because of the emergence of various cloud storage services with different qualities of services. Therefore, the users may not only be anxious about the state of their data on the cloud server, but also concern on whether the data are transferred entirely to the new cloud without corruption and whether the data on original cloud are discarded. To address these problems, we propose a provable data possession scheme for cloud storage services characterized by secure data transfer, provable data erasure, high error detection probability, confidential data storage. Our scheme can guarantee the remote data integrity when the data are maintaining on the cloud servers and are transferring between two clouds, and secure deletion of transferred data on the original cloud.},

	abstract = {In-memory computing (IMC) architectures provide a much needed solution to energy-efficiency barriers posed by Von-Neumann computing. The functions implemented in such in-memory architectures are often proprietary and constitute confidential intellectual property (IP). Our studies indicate that IMC architectures implemented using resistive RAM (RRAM) are susceptible to side channel attack (SCA). Unlike the conventional SCAs that are aimed to leak private keys from cryptographic implementations, SCA on IMC for reverse engineering (SCARE) can reveal the sensitive IP implemented within the memory through power/timing side channels. Therefore, the adversary does not need to perform invasive reverse engineering (RE) to unlock the functionality. We demonstrate SCARE by taking recent IMC architectures, such as dynamic computing in memory (DCIM) and memristor-aided logic (MAGIC) as test cases. Simulation results indicate that AND, OR, and NOR gates (which are the building blocks of complex functions) yield distinct power and timing signatures based on the number of inputs, making them vulnerable to SCA. We show that adversary can use templates (using foundry-calibrated simulations or fabricating known functions in test chips) and analysis to identify the structure of the implemented function by testing a limited number of patterns. We also propose countermeasures, such as redundant inputs and expansion of literals. Redundant inputs can mask the IP with 25\% area and 20\% power overhead. However, functions can be found at higher RE effort. Expansion of literals incurs 36\% power overhead. However, it imposes a brute force search increasing the adversarial RE effort by 3.04{\textbackslash}times .},

Blockchain platforms for public networks ignore requirements for private transactions due to user anonymity and the absence of personal data in blockchain networks. Enterprise blockchain platforms for corporate networks mostly address confidential issues by transferring private data through trusted third parties (TTP) or intermediaries, and off-chain peer-to-peer messaging.

However, this complex expansion does not always succeed due to its dependence on third parties to evaluate the search and the possible compromise on the privacy of the stored information.

This can create a bottleneck for wide-scale adoption of SiL-systems. We propose a data-flow architecture using trusted-computing technologies (e.g. Intel-SGX) to protect models and IP in cloud-based SiL environments. We illustrate that these protections can be designed to be compatible with existing SiL tools and workflows with minimal modifications. Further, we highlight the need for future standardization efforts of such security architectures in the SiL domain.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, storing confidential documents using cloud services is getting popular due to advantages regarding security and fast processing operations. One of the major services of cloud computing is cloud storage, which is conversely raises some issues regarding information security. Storing information for cooperation such as a bank in the cloud needs a fast processing operation to avoid any bottleneck in the work procedure. Therefore, Quick Response (QR) code is highly required to be utilized in these operations. The advantage of the QR code is easier for reading information by just scanning using any reader available on smart devices. The methodology is to integrate the security with QR code to save the text bank information. This is done by converting text to the QR code as an image form, then applying a cryptography algorithm to the QR code image then upload it to the cloud storage. Later on, once the plaintext is required to be reconstructed, the same operations are applied exactly to the encryption phase. In which the same algorithm will be applied for decryption then a QR code reader is used to preview the target bank text. For security matters, a key is used to be embedded in the protection operation. The type of encryption is proposed to be a symmetric One-time-pad (OTP) cryptography algorithm.},

While many schemes have been proposed to perform the individual functionalities, less attention has been made to more complete solutions featuring multiple desired functionalities. In this paper, we present a solution that incorporates search, phrase search, auditing where resources are reused for enabling each functionality, achieving an overall smaller storage cost, complexity than implementing each of the functionalities separately. The solution performs search over encrypted documents as efficiently as the leading phrase search scheme in the literature while also enabling unlimited number of audit queries.},

As data processing, communications, and control are performed more closely to the end-user devices in fog computing, chances for the attackers to gain unauthorized accesses to sensitive data have been greatly increased. In this paper, we propose a new resource-efficient physical unclonable function (PUF) based authentication scheme to protect the security and privacy of the confidential information in edge devices. Unlike other PUF based lightweight authentication schemes, our proposed method remarkably increases the machine learning attack time without requiring a server to store a large amount of challenge response pairs (CRPs). Besides, a new strong PUF with feedback loop is employed in our scheme to further resist the machine learning attacks that have demonstrated efficacy in compromising strong PUFs. Our proof-of-concept implementation shows that the proposed scheme is suitable for resource-constrained end-user devices in terms of memory, computation, and security.},

	abstract = {This paper applies an approach of resilience engineering in studying how effective encrypted searches will be. One of the concerns on encrypted searches is frequency attacks. In frequency attacks, adversaries guess the meaning of the encrypted words by observing a large number of encrypted words in search queries and mapping the encrypted words to guessed plain text words using their known histogram. Thus, it is important for defenders to know how many encrypted words adversaries need to observe before they correctly guess the encrypted words. However, doing so takes long time for defenders because of the large volume of the encrypted words involved. We developed and evaluated Moving Average Bootstrap (MAB) method for estimating the number of encrypted words (N*) an adversary needs to observe before an adversary correctly guesses a certain percentage of the observed words with a certain confidence. Our experiments indicate that MAB method lets defenders to estimate N* using only 5\% of the time, compared to the cases without MAB. Because of the significant reduction in the required time for estimating N*, MAB will contribute to the safety in encrypted searches.},

But as the individuals and enterprises are now inclined towards these services, security has always been a concern. People are worried about security issues of their data being secure, safe and confidential over the cloud. Authentication and Authorization of data and accounts is more than just a requirement. Our Proposed methodology, along with implementation of encryption of user data when it is uploaded to the servers, reduces the cost overhead of encryption as we are not using standalone hardware servers for encryption which waste resources even if they are not in use. Our method will be implementing Docker instances which will be used as an encryption server, which will use resources only when a file is received and after encrypting the file, the docker instance will be shut down, hence reducing the resource usage and reducing the cost altogether. A docker instance in layman language is a virtual environment that is launched within a second of file receiving and is shut down in the same time, encrypting the file as well. Hence it makes encryption servers use resource only when necessary. This approach removes the need of physical encryption servers to a greater extent. Now even if the servers are compromised, the data is in encrypted form and hence is secured as there is a single encryption algorithm written in code which is executed only when the docker instance is launched.},

The success of data mining depends on the quality of data and the algorithms used to extract information. A large number of tools and techniques have been developed for the purpose. Soft Computing methods have also emerged as a powerful tool for data mining as soft computing is tolerant to uncertainty, partial truth and imprecision. It helps in achieving solutions that are low cost, robust and tractable. Neural Networks are being extensively used for analysis purposes in every field of life from business to health sectors. In the current scenario where privacy of an individual is an important issue, people are reluctant to share their confidential information. Thereby privacy preserving in data mining (PPDM) has emerged as an indistinguishable component of data mining. The aim of this paper is to propose a model that preserves the privacy of individuals without affecting the final results of the Neural Networks.},

Specifically, in confidential inference, Alice has the parameters of the machine-learning model but does not want to reveal them to Bob who has the data. Bob wants to use Alice’s model for inference but does not want to reveal his data. Alice and Bob agree to use homomorphic encryption for running the inference engine in full confidence without revealing either model or data. They find that full homomorphic encryption is very time consuming and very challenging to accelerate on hardware. In this particular case, homomorphic encryption can be made computationally efficient and can even be readily accelerated on hardware. In this paper, we reveal how Alice and Bob run the inference engine in full confidence and show an FPGA implementation of the specialized homomorphic computing algorithm they used. We further evaluate the resources needed to implement the encrypted decision tree and compare them with those of a plain decision tree. Confidential inference tests are run on the encrypted FPGA design using the MNIST dataset.},

This feature attracts many individual and organization to store their large data over cloud. It relieves the owner from its storage and management task as well as achieves great flexibility with economical cost. The data which owner wants to store over cloud may also contains some confidential data or information which requires extra security concern before storing it over un-trusted network. Security becomes a basic requirement before migrating any confidential data over cloud. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid symmetric encryption approach to provide more security for owner's data other than any single symmetric encryption algorithm. This use of hybrid approach makes data more secure and protect it from any malicious activity attended by intruder. Brute force attack also becomes impossible after using this proposed approach. Use of symmetric encryption also increases the processing ability as it has fast processing speed and efficient than asymmetric approach.},

Data recovery is one of the important concepts while dealing with storage devices which are basically the backbone of the cloud infrastructure. Someone with access to these servers or devices can use data recovery techniques to reconstruct the confidential data of customers once the customers have deleted their confidential or private data from the cloud. Reconstruction of such data leads to a security problem and privacy concerns for users. Even after some gains access to their data users are not aware that someone else has access to their data even though it has already deleted in their point of view from the cloud. In this paper, we look into the security problem which can arise based on the usage of data recovery tools on cloud infrastructure, once the users have deleted their data.

	abstract = {Recently, more and more enterprises have adopted hybrid cloud strategies to simultaneously enjoy the security of on-premise clouds and the low cost of public clouds. The key challenge of hybrid clouds, though, stems from the difficulty of specifying where the data should be stored and where the information could flow efficiently. In order to meet security concerns and performance requirements, we introduce a coarse-grained information flow control (CIFC) model to limit storing, accessing, and disclosing of confidential data in public clouds. The CIFC model aims at providing information control implicitly, without the large overhead of periodically checking access privileges. Moreover, since the CIFC model may request redistributing data whenever the secrecy level of a dataset changes, we formulate the data redistribution problem as an optimization problem and propose the Partition Biased Sampling Algorithm (PBSA) for its solution. We implemented the CIFC model on top of Spark, and our results show that Spark applications can achieve 1.4 to 2.1 times better performance by utilizing the additional computational capacity of public cloud to process non-sensitive data. Furthermore, we integrate the PBSA algorithm into Spark and demonstrate a saving of more than 35\% in execution time, compared to the Spark default data distribution strategy.},

The main feature of using cloud services is that user's data are more often processed at remote machines which are unknown to user. As user do not own these remote machine used for speed up data processing or operate them in cloud, users can lose control of own confidential data. Despite of all of advantages of cloud this remains a challenge and acts as a barrier to the large scale adoption of cloud. To address above problem in this paper we present object oriented approach that performs automated logging mechanism to ensure any access to user's data will trigger authentication with use of decentralized information accountability framework called as CIA (Cloud Information Accountability) [1]. We use the JAR (JAVA Archive File) programmable capabilities to create dynamic travelling object containing user's data. To strengthen the distributed data security we use the chaos image encryption technique specific to image files. Chaos is patchy image encryption technique based on pixel shuffling.

	abstract = {Security has been considered as the key concern of adopting cloud computing. This could be ascribed to the customers' lack of control over their confidential data once in the cloud and to the absence of trust in cloud providers. Unfortunately, the research efforts in the area of cloud security have not yet succeeded to give the required "peace of mind" to cloud customers. Therefore, in an attempt to figure out the main loopholes in cloud security, this paper questions the fundamental principles of the security approaches in the cloud. The paper highlights two main drawbacks, the first is due to a potential incompatibility among security measures, while the other is due to the focus on securing the infrastructure rather than the data itself. Therefore, the paper advocates the need for integrating information-centric security approaches, and hence presents a novel security framework that adopts both infrastructure and information-centric security services.},

At the same time, donors are unable to track the use of single donation funds. In this paper, we propose a scheme to assist in regulation through blockchain, using blockchain technology to track the use of charitable funds, speed up the auditing process of funds, and enhance the transparency of the use of charitable funds.

Specifically, first, using the characteristics of the wireless channel, comprehensively consider the channel quality of the power terminal users, and under the constraint of confidentiality capacity, the objective function is to minimize the weighted sum of delay and energy consumption to achieve partial safe offloading; Secondly, by designing the Lagrangian multiplier optimization algorithm to achieve the optimal transmission power under the condition of confidential capacity constraints. The simulation results show that this scheme has advantages in security compared with the traditional unloading scheme, and ensures the data security of the power terminal users.},

Moreover, the users also expect their data, stored on to the cloud should be more secured, confidential, and authorized. The encrypted data stored at server and it is decrypted at client side. In this article, we proposed cryptographic mechanisms that verify the uniqueness of data stored at cloud is same as original data put by the client. Additionally, we have also explored the existing cryptographic algorithms, namely DES, AES, Paillier and Blowfish for the comparison.

We present a novel system named CAFE for cloud infrastructures where sensitive software logic can be executed with high secrecy protected from any piracy or reverse engineering attempts in a virtual machine even when its operating system kernel is compromised. The key mechanism is the end-to-end framework for the execution of applications, which consists of the secure encryption and distribution of confidential application binary files, and the runtime techniques to load, decrypt, and protect the program logic by isolating them from tenant virtual machines based on hypervisor-level techniques. We evaluate applications in several software categories which are commonly offered in cloud marketplaces showing that strong confidential execution can be provided with only marginal changes (around 100-220 lines of code) and minimal performance overhead. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of CAFE in cloud marketplaces.},

	abstract = {A cloud database is a system that typically runs on a cloud computing platform which is not maintained by the user but a service provider. The service provider can leak confidential data, modify the data, or return inconsistent data to users due to bugs, crashes, operator errors, or even malicious security attacks. Some cloud database systems provide Web interface or application programming interface for clients to access logs of database transactions. However, these logs are not cryptographic proofs. Clients cannot use these logs to prove whether a cloud service provider has violated some required properties such as data integrity, write serializability, and read freshness. A proof of violation (POV) scheme enables a client or a service provider to produce a precise proof of either the occurrence of the violation of properties or the innocence of the service provider. In this paper, we develop POV schemes for cloud database systems. First, we show that previously proposed cryptographic accountability protocols (CAPs), cannot be applied to cloud database systems directly. A CAP defines a multi-step handshaking protocol for clients and the service provider to exchange signed messages during service request and response so as to generate cryptographic proofs for later auditing. In addition, previously proposed auditing schemes are inappropriate to obtain the auditing requirements of SQL database according to collected cryptographic proofs. We design a new auditing scheme for cloud database systems. Implementation and experimental results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed schemes. Service providers can use the proposed schemes to provide a mutual nonrepudiation guarantee for database transactions in their service-level agreements.},

To be able to remotely enforce usage control policy the processing party requires a trusted execution environ-ment such as Intel SGX which creates so-called enclaves. In this paper we introduce Multi Enclave based Code from Template (MECT), an SGX-based architecture for trusted remote policy enforcement. MECT uses a multi-enclave approach in which an enclave generation service dynamically generates enclaves from pre-defined code and dynamic policy parameters. This approach leads to a small trusted computing base and highly simplified attestation while preserving functionality benefits. Our proof of concept implementation consumes customisable code from templates. We compare the implementation with other architectures regarding the trusted computing base, flexibility, performance, and modularity. This comparison highlights the security benefits for remote attestation of MECT.},

Database-as-a-service is service model provided by cloud computing to store, manage and process data on a cloud platform. Database-as-a-service has key characteristics such as availability, scalability, elasticity. A customer does not have to worry about database installation and management. As a replacement, the cloud database service provider takes responsibility for installing and maintaining the database. The real problem occurs when it comes to storing confidential or private information in the cloud database, we cannot rely on the cloud data vendor. A curious cloud database vendor may capture and leak the secret information. For that purpose, Protected Database-as-a-service is a novel solution to this problem that provides provable and pragmatic privacy in the face of a compromised cloud database service provider. Protected Database-as-a-service defines various encryption schemes to choose encryption algorithm and encryption key to encrypt and decrypt data. It also provides "Master key" to users, so that a metadata storage table can be decrypted only by using the master key of the users. As a result, a cloud service vendor never gets access to decrypted data, and even if all servers are jeopardized, in such inauspicious circumstances a cloud service vendor will not be able to decrypt the data. Proposed Protected Database-as-a-service system allows multiple geographically distributed clients to execute concurrent and independent operation on encrypted data and also conserve data confidentiality and consistency at cloud level, to eradicate any intermediate server between the client and the cloud database.},

To protect sensitive data stored in the cloud is crucial and to ensure data privacy, confidentiality, and integrity for cloud users. The cloud as a platform enables real-time patient monitoring via the use of sensors, which has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry. Users transmit sensitive and classified medical information to cloud service providers for centralized storage and processing. This presents cybercriminals with the opportunity to acquire data, interfere with ongoing data processes, and restrict healthcare professionals and patients from accessing confidential information. For a healthcare organization to feel comfortable with and use the cloud computing platform, privacy and security are the two most pressing concerns. Fine-grained access control (FGAC) is used as a tool for controlling who may see what data in a cloud-based healthcare setting. Protects private medical information by limiting who may see it, change it, or even access it at all. Over the last several years, advances in machine learning have made cloud data security one of the most promising areas in the field.

The proposed architectures either do not provide security inside the IoT network or do not evaluate the overhead imposed in the IoT devices. In order to fill this gap, this work evaluates and enhances an architecture for privacy in the integration of IoT and cloud computing by providing a method to protect the data generated by IoT devices without the use of a secure transport layer protocol, decreasing the amount of resources consumed by these devices.

Real-world cloud storage systems frequently experience data leaks, making secure data transmission and copyright protection of multimedia information difficult. To tackle the problem of safeguarding copyright, the implementation of digital watermarking has been proposed. This technique involves adding hidden information, such as confidential data, to digital media to authenticate its ownership. Encryption techniques are also employed to secure the data and prevent unauthorized access. The proposed approach suggests using both watermarking and proxy re-encryption techniques to efficiently exchange multimedia content. To secure confidential information, the process involves encrypting a private key with a specific encryption method that requires a key. Next, this encrypted key is combined with the user's private key and inserted into an image using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. After the confidential information has been incorporated into the image, it can be encoded using the ECC Encryption technique. However, copyright protection remains a challenging and complex issue in the face of increasing internet and digital technology usage.

The master wants to distribute these computations to untrusted workers who have volunteered or are incentivized to help with this task. However, the data must be kept private (in an information theoretic sense) and not revealed to the individual workers. The workers may be busy and will take a random time to finish the task assigned to them. We are interested in reducing the aggregate delay experienced by the master. We focus on linear computations as an essential operation in many iterative algorithms. A known solution is to use a linear secret sharing scheme to divide the data into secret shares on which the workers can compute. We propose to use instead new secure codes, called Staircase codes, introduced previously by two of the authors. We study the delay induced by Staircase codes which is always less than that of secret sharing. The reason is that secret sharing schemes need to wait for the responses of a fixed fraction of the workers, whereas Staircase codes offer more flexibility in this respect. For instance, for codes with rate R = 1/2 Staircase codes can lead to up to 40\% reduction in delay compared to secret sharing.},

However, data protection is considered to be an issue, especially for highly secret information. Users usually trust cloud storage providers who do not leak information, but the administrator and tools they use can access arbitrary storage data. One approach against these problems is encrypting files stored in cloud storage. Using encryption, files are kept confidential, but this requires a complicated procedure and understanding of some specific level of cryptography. In this paper, we propose a secure cloud filesystem that enables files to be encrypted and decrypted transparently when storing to or extracting from the filesystem. Each file is protected using a key-based encryption mechanism, and the keys are also stored on the cloud filesystem in secure indexed with the pathname of the target files. This enables users to easily use secure cloud storage that maintains confidentiality and share data using multiple cloud storages without the users needing special knowledge on encryption.},

	abstract = {Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is fastest growing technology era in which the research society has recently embarked. Today, Mobile data can include financial transactions such as electronic payments, M-wallets and sensitive multimedia contents. The explosive volumes of mobile devices personal data, bring-up more attention to securely data storage rather than consideration on data privacy and confidentiality levels. In this scenario Machine Leaning (ML) brings an important role in the electronic data management. It is always expensive and hard to manage the data manually without adopting machine learning techniques using metadata. Many Machine Learning algorithms have been proposed to comprehend diverse data management issues, yet the forecast of the top secret data and public data in a document is as yet a challenging exploration task. The contribution of this research article is to demonstrate a securing mobile data storage secrecy and privacy in cloud communication framework in terms of automatic data classification using mobile training datasets with help of Training dataset Filtration Key Nearest Neighbor (TsF-KNN) classifier which classifies the data based on the confidentiality level of the record with higher accuracy and powerful timelines as compared to the traditional K-NN algorithms and securing such confidential data category afterwards by applying various existing cryptographic solutions to assuring data privacy and confidentiality levels and simulation results demonstrates that reducing the overall cost and minimize procedural time, increasing system performance and sustainability.},

Furthermore, employees without security awareness and training are highly vulnerable to endpoint attacks, network attacks, and zero-day attacks that lead to a breach of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). In this context, this paper proposes a comprehensive solution; ‘BYODENCE’, for the detection and prevention of unauthorized access to organizational documents.

	abstract = {Trustworthy and real-time video surveillance aims to analyze the live camera streams in a privacy-preserving manner for the decision-making of various advanced services, such as pedestrian reidentification and traffic monitoring. In recent years, edge computing has been identified as a promising technology for trustworthy and real-time video surveillance because it keeps confidential video data locally and reduces the latency caused by massive data transmission. Generally, a single edge device can hardly afford the computation-intensive video analytics tasks. Most existing solutions incorporate cloud servers to handle the overloaded tasks. However, such an edge-cloud collaboration approach still suffers from unpredictable latency and privacy concerns because the remote cloud is centralized and distant from the cameras. In this work, we designed a blockchain-based collaborative edge intelligence (BCEI) approach for trustworthy and real-time video surveillance. In BCEI, geo-distributed edge devices form a peer-to-peer network to maintain a permissioned blockchain and share data and computation resources to perform computation-intensive video analytics tasks. The video analytics results are written on the blockchain in an immutable manner to guarantee trustworthiness. To reduce task execution time, we formulate and solve a joint stream mapping and task scheduling problem to schedule video streams and machine learning models among edge devices. A pedestrian reidentification prototype is implemented and deployed based on BCEI with the extensive performance evaluation, indicating the superiority of BCEI in latency reduction and system throughput improvement by leveraging collaboration among edge devices.},

	abstract = {Using public cloud services for storing and sharing confidential data requires end users to cryptographically protect both the data and the access to the data. In some cases, the identity of end users needs to remain confidential against the cloud provider and fellow users accessing the data. As such, the underlying cryptographic access control mechanism needs to ensure the anonymity of both data producers and consumers. We introduce A-SKY, a cryptographic access control extension capable of providing confidentiality and anonymity guarantees, all while efficiently scaling to large organizations. A-SKY leverages trusted execution environments (TEEs) to address the impracticality of anonymous broadcast encryption (ANOBE) schemes, achieving faster execution times and shorter ciphertexts. The innovative design of A-SKY limits the usage of the TEE to the narrow set of data producing operations, and thus optimizes the dominant data consumption actions by not requiring a TEE. Furthermore, we propose a scalable implementation for A-SKY leveraging micro-services that preserves strong security guarantees while being able to efficiently manage realistic large user bases. Results highlight that the A-SKY cryptographic scheme is 3 orders of magnitude better than state of the art ANOBE, and an end-to-end system encapsulating A-SKY can elastically scale to support groups of 10000 users while maintaining processing costs below 1 second.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing provides the facility for large volume data storage and its management. It has enormous capacity for storing many users and individual data simultaneously and provides the flexibility for its retrieval at anytime and anywhere. Today many organizations are migrating towards cloud for its data storage and retrieval because of their complex data management at economical cost and great flexibility. Even though cloud attracting lots of attention still there is prime requirement of security concerns needs to be take care. Cloud is un-trusted third party, holding the data which may be confidential r sensitive. Security and privacy of data is prime concern. In this paper, we proposed a new security model which utilizes the concept of hybrid encryption and decryption to provide a secure and protected environment for cloud data storage. In the proposed model, data owner (DO) outsource the encrypted data at cloud server to make it hidden from intruder and provide only authorized user with the corresponding decryption key to retrieve the original data. Use of hybrid encryption makes the data more protected from any malicious activity and provide a sound and secure system. During encryption or decryption process the concept of symmetric key cryptography is utilize as it is more efficient and fast than public key cryptography.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has revolutionized organizational operations by providing convenient, on-demand access to resources. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has introduced a new paradigm for collaborative computing, leveraging sensors and devices that generate and process vast amounts of data, thereby resulting in challenges related to scalability and security, making the significance of conventional security methods even more pronounced. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a novel Scalable and Secure Cloud Architecture (SSCA) that integrates IoT and cryptographic techniques, aiming to develop scalable and trustworthy cloud systems, thus enabling multi-user systems and facilitating simultaneous access to cloud resources by multiple users. The design adopts a decentralized approach, utilizing multiple cloud nodes to handle user requests efficiently and incorporates Multicast and Broadcast Rekeying Algorithm (MBRA) to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of user information, utilizing a hybrid cryptosystem that combines MBRA, Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and blockchain technology. Leveraging IoT devices, the architecture gathers data from distributed sensing resources and ensures the security of collected information through robust MBRA-PQC encryption algorithms, while the blockchain ensures that the confidential data is stored in distributed and immutable records. The proposed approach is applied to several datasets and the effectiveness is validated through various performance metrics, including response time, throughput, scalability, security, and reliability. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed SSCA, showcasing a notable reduction in response time by 1.67 seconds and 0.97 seconds for 250 and 1000 devices, respectively, in comparison to the MHE-IS-CPMT. Likewise, SSCA demonstrated significant improvements in the AUC values, exhibiting enhancements of 6.30\%, 6.90\%, 7.60\%, and 7.30\% at the 25-user level, and impressive gains of 5.20\%, 9.30\%, 11.50\%, and 15.40\% at the 50-user level when compared to the MHE-IS-CPMT, EAM, SCSS, and SHCEF models, respectively.},

	abstract = {Big data has become a key basis of innovation and intelligence, potentially making our lives more convenient and bringing new opportunities to the modern society. Towards this goal, a critical underlying task is to solve a series of large-scale fundamental problems. Conducting such large-scale data analytics in a timely manner requires a large amount of computing resources, which may not be available for individuals and small companies in practice. By outsourcing their computations to the cloud, clients can solve such problems in a cost-effective way. However, confidential data stored at the cloud is vulnerable to cyber attacks, and thus needs to be protected. Previous works employ cryptographic techniques like homomorphic encryption, which significantly increase the computational complexity of solving a large-scale problem at the cloud and is impractical for big data applications. For the first time in the literature, we present an efficient secure outsourcing scheme for convex separable programming problems (CSPs). In particular, we first develop efficient matrix and vector transformation schemes only based on arithmetic operations that are computationally indistinguishable both in value and in structure under a chosen-plaintext attack (CPA). Then, we design a secure outsourcing scheme in which the client and the cloud collaboratively solve the transformed problems. The client can efficiently verify the correctness of returned results to prevent any malicious behavior of the cloud. Theoretical correctness and privacy analysis together show that the proposed scheme obtains optimal results and that the cloud cannot learn private information from the client's concealed data. We conduct extensive simulations on Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) platform and find that our proposed scheme provides significant time savings to the clients.},

	abstract = {Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is a platform that allows mobile users to offload the computationally rigorous and storage demanding tasks on available cloud resources using wireless access. The major concern with MCC is the privacy of data. Mobile users give confidential information through the network, that if not safeguarded may lead to security issues. Identity Management (IDM) is the management of user identities, their authentication, and authorization in the cloud environment. The existing Consolidated Identity Management (CIDM) overcomes the network traffic interception in the traditional IDM but is prone to Identity theft in case of Identity Management Server (IDMS) compromise. This work is focused on the development of a Secure Identity Management (SIDM) that alleviates the attacks in the CIDM by using techniques that strengthens the authentication process and identity privacy. A secure IDM is developed using two-step authentication process which involves Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) and token verification. The proposed SIDM model reduces the consequences of Identity server compromise attack. There is a marginal increase in the communication overhead of SIDM compared to that of CIDM but it can be compromised to realize the benefits of identity privacy. The analysis of the experimental results shows that there is an overall increase of thirty percent in communication overhead when compared to CIDM.},

In our scheme, a user's access privileges are described by an access structure consisting of several attributes while ciphertexts are labeled by several target attributes. A delegator can transform the original ciphertexts into proxy ciphertexts encrypted by the delegatee's attributes without leaking any sensitive information to the cloud server. Besides, a search request on the ciphertexts is allowed by a delegatee if his credentials satisfy the delegatee's access policy.

	abstract = {Cloud-based enterprise search services (e.g., AWS Kendra) have been entrancing big data owners by offering convenient and real-time search solutions to them. However, the problem is that individuals and organizations possessing confidential big data are hesitant to embrace such services due to valid data privacy concerns. In addition, to offer an intelligent search, these services access the user’s search history that further jeopardizes his/her privacy. To overcome the privacy problem, the main idea of this research is to separate the intelligence aspect of the search from its pattern matching aspect. According to this idea, the search intelligence is provided by an on-premises edge tier and the shared cloud tier only serves as an exhaustive pattern matching search utility. We propose Smartness at Edge (SAED mechanism that offers intelligence in the form of semantic and personalized search at the edge tier while maintaining privacy of the search on the cloud tier. At the edge tier, SAED uses a knowledge-based lexical database to expand the query and cover its semantics. SAED personalizes the search via an RNN model that can learn the user’s interest. A word embedding model is used to retrieve documents based on their semantic relevance to the search query. SAED is generic and can be plugged into existing enterprise search systems and enable them to offer intelligent and privacy-preserving search without enforcing any change on them. Evaluation results on two enterprise search systems under real settings and verified by human users demonstrate that SAED can improve the relevancy of the retrieved results by on average ≈24\% for plain-text and ≈75\% for encrypted generic datasets.},

This paper presents a diagnostic data protection scheme for cytometry-based point-of-care systems. Our solution consists in a biomarker detection sensor integrated with a smartphone to provide users with easy-to-use real-time diagnostic capabilities, thereby, reducing the need for in-person clinical visits. The proposed hardware-level trusted sensing framework obfuscates the measured analog signals that relate to patient's blood cell counts. The diagnostic outcome, based on the cell counts, is protected through an encryption scheme, before sending out the data through the smartphone to the cloud for analysis. The outcome of the analysis is then sent back to the device for decryption and user notifications. The proposed data protection scheme is realized for a prototype consisting of a biosensor connected to a smartphone. A smartphone app and cloud-based service that perform the analysis have also been implemented. This design guarantees the user's privacy by considering the smartphone and the cloud server possibly untrusted: the proposed setup assumes a curious but honest security model. The proposed encryption scheme infringes no overhead while the decryption and diagnostic calculations are {\textless};1 s in average. An evaluation of the strength of the signal obfuscation mechanism via a general case study is also presented.

	abstract = {The cloud computing environment provides easy-to-access service for private and confidential data. However, there are many threats to the leakage of private data. This paper focuses on investigating the vulnerabilities of cloud service providers (CSPs) from three risk aspects: management risks, law risks, and technology risks. Additionally, this paper presents a risk assessment model that is based on grey system theory (GST), defines indicators for assessment, and fully utilizes the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Furthermore, we use the GST to predict the risk values by using the MATLAB platform. The GST determines the bottom evaluation sequence, while the AHP calculates the index weights. Based on the GST and the AHP, layer-based assessment values are determined for the bottom evaluation sequence and the index weights. The combination of AHP and GST aims to obtain systematic and structured well-defined procedures that are based on step-by-step processes. The AHP and GST methods are applied successfully to handle any risk assessment problem of the CSP. Furthermore, substantial challenges are encountered in determining the CSP's response time and identifying the most suitable solution out of a specified series of solutions. This issue has been handled using two additive features: the response time and the grey incidence. The final risk values are calculated and can be used for prediction by utilizing the enhanced grey model (EGM) (1,1), which reduces the prediction error by providing direct forecast to avoid the iterative prediction shortcoming of standard GM (1,1). Thus, EGM (1,1) helps maintain the reliability on a larger scale despite utilizing more prediction periods. Based on the experimental results, we evaluate the validity, accuracy, and response time of the proposed approach. The simulation experiments were conducted to validate the suitability of the proposed model. The simulation results demonstrate that our risk assessment model contributes to reducing deviation to support CSPs with the three adopted models.},

Image CNN features are once considered confidential for image retrieval in cloud computing. However, recent studies have shown that these features contain ambiguous semantic information and can be reconstructed to images. We design a computable encryption scheme based on vector and matrix calculations for the risk of CNN feature-based image retrieval. The scheme uses SIFT and CNN features to pre-build a feature-based index to provide feature-related information about each encrypted image and then chooses the efficient image similarity measure as the pruning tool to carry out the retrieval procedure. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that the scheme is INI-CCA. The experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved excellent results on content-based image retrieval.},

	abstract = {This Full paper in the Innovative Practice Category introduces an innovative visual privacy themed pre-university educational module using social media apps for creating privacy awareness as well as teaching societal and human security topics. With the advent of internet (World Wide Web) and social media, and the extensive use of these resources by naïve young users, privacy issues pop up every now and then. The lack of privacy and security awareness may lead to confidential information leaks during the use of online contents, particularly social media. The current IEEE/ACM curricular guidelines in CS, IT and cybersecurity clearly point to a need for inclusion of societal and human security topics at the college level, so that a general awareness can be created regarding today's growing privacy concerns, including privacy issues with media sharing. However, there is still a gap within the K-12 curriculum in regard to these security and privacy topics. Even though there has been some computing educational research work on the topic of data privacy at the K-12 level, the visual privacy theme under the societal and human security domain has hardly been explored within K-12. None of the K-12 cybersecurity educational modules have employed the privacy-enhanced computer vision theme along with a social media platform. This paper intends to address the this gap by presenting a visual privacy themed lesson plan using social media apps for teaching privacy, ethics and machine learning. Its main contribution is a unique visual privacy education based hands-on outreach module that utilizes the PVA (Privacy through Visual Anonymity) notion to teach privacy, ethics and machine learning using media images and videos. Our module uses two freely accessible apps, namely an Obscura Cam and YouTube - Face Blur. These apps are utilized to illustrate the concept of visual privacy and demonstrate PVA in pictures and media clips. Additionally, this paper describes our research case study conducted by piloting our PVA workshop module at the middle-school level. This paper discusses and analyzes the learner data obtained from the workshop participants as part of our Google IgniteCS outreach project. The learning analytics survey data collected during our PVA workshop sessions with various middle-school participants indicate that the described visual privacy module can become a simple yet effective tool for privacy literacy, as it can help build privacy perceptions in young minds. Our acquired results also suggest that that this PVA themed outreach lesson plan can be used as a potential medium for recruiting K-12 students into computing and cybersecurity disciplines.},

In particular, the RIPless measurement matrix is used to give CS the resistance against plaintext attack, while the first-order {\textbackslash}Sigma {\textbackslash}Delta quantizer is employed to embed the cryptographic diffusion feature into the whole system. Two chaotic systems are employed for generating the required secret elements for the acquisition and encryption.

	abstract = {In this paper, we improve and expand the attacks tracer to receive information from real networks and to simulate advanced persistent threats in the networks based on it. Our improvement of the proposed system helps administrators to correctly recognize the status of the system and to expect near future events. Advanced persistent threats are cyber attacks that mainly target the information systems of organizations such as governments, research institutes, and enterprises. The attacks are characterized by long-lasting and continuous attacks that eventually result in the seizure of confidential information. In the past, system administrators and/or designers conducted digital forensic analysis. However the analysis is difficult because the number of communication traffic and connected devices are increasing now. The attacks tracer is a software that uses the actor model to simulate the behavior of an information system by modeling networked devices such as routers and servers abstractly. The abstract model and the actor model give the attacks tracer a scalable concurrency. Therefore the attacks tracer simulates a lot of attack scenarios of advanced persistent threats. However the attacks tracer before improvement we have implemented can only simulate specific scenarios in virtual spaces, and cannot analyze actual attacks. Therefore, in this proposal, we implemented the interface of gRPC, which is a high performance remote procedure call framework, in the attacks tracer. This allows attacks tracer to receive and analyze events that occur on the network immediately, thus the attacks tracer can simulate actual attacks. For example, if a system such as a firewall detects that an attack has occurred from a PC in the network, the attacks tracer can use that information to determine that the PC has been infected with malware and then indicate what kind of attack will occur. As a result of applying the attacks tracer to a real network, we found that the attacks tracer can get feedback from a real system and simulate advanced persistent threats based on it. The overview of the attacks tracer before improvement, the implementation method for applying to real environments and the case study are presented in this paper.},

To reduce the storing space and save the bandwidth share the data with others in cloud storage using public-key cryptosystems that produce constant-size cipher texts such that the active delegation of decoding rights for any set of cipher texts but it lead to many privacy problems. To avoid this problem the private and public cloud combine and form a hybrid cloud. In this the confidential data can be stored in private cloud and other data are stored in public cloud. Even though, the exponential growth of ever-increasing volume of data in the cloud has raised many storage challenges. To overcome these challenges we proposed a deduplication technique. It is specialized and resent data compression technique which eliminates redundant data as well as improves the cloud storage and bandwidth utilization. We also present several new deduplication constructions which are supporting authorized duplicate check in hybrid cloud architecture. To protect the confidentiality of sensitive data, where as supporting deduplication, the convergent encryption technique has been proposed to encrypt the data before outsourcing. To provide the highest data security, this paper makes the first attempt to formally address the problem of authorized data deduplication. We also proposed many new deduplication constructions supporting authorized duplicate check in hybrid cloud architecture, which incurs nominal overhead compared to conventional operation.},

	abstract = {Decentralizing multi-authority attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been adopted for solving problems arising from sharing confidential corporate data in cloud computing. For decentralizing multiauthority ABE systems that do not rely on a central authority, collusion resistance can be achieved using a global identifier. Therefore, identity needs to be managed globally, which results in the crucial problems of privacy and security. A scheme is developed that does not use a central authority to manage users and keys, and only simple trust relations need to be formed by sharing the public key between each attribute authority (AA). User identities are unique by combining a user's identity with the identity of the AA where the user is located. Once a key request needs to be made to an authority outside the domain, the request needs to be performed by the authority in the current domain rather than by the users, so, user identities remain private to the AA outside the domain, which will enhance privacy and security. In addition, the key issuing protocol between AA is simple as the result of the trust relationship of AA. Moreover, extensibility for authorities is also supported by the scheme presented in this paper. The scheme is based on composite order bilinear groups. A proof of security is presented that uses the dual system encryption methodology.},

Among these proposals we can find solutions for certified notifications, digital signature of contracts, escrow protocols, fair payments and registered deliveries. In order to execute fair exchanges, most solutions involve trusted third parties, known as TTP, supervising the exchanges in a way or another. Until now, two solutions have been presented for Registered electronic Delivery (eDelivery) services. This service allows a user to prove that he has sent some data to a set of receivers. These protocols differ in the properties achieved and also in the use of trusted third parties. The first protocol is a blockchain-based solution without TTP for the eDelivery of non-confidential data. The second protocol allows also the eDelivery of confidential data. However, this second proposal requires the involvement of a TTP in a non-mandatory resolution phase. In this paper we present a new protocol that achieves the best properties of the previous solutions at the same time. The new protocol doesn't require the involvement of a TTP at any moment while it allows the eDelivery of confidential data, satisfying the security requirements for this service.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates an agile confidential transmission strategy combining big data driven cluster and opportunistic beamforming (OBF) in the scenario where the same huge content is downloaded simultaneously by many users from the same base station. Instead of a burden from the traditional perspective, big data can be viewed as a resource. With the help of big data, data driven cluster taking into account security issues can be formed. Due to some obvious advantages, physical layer security (PHY-security) techniques as an alternative to the traditional high complexity cryptography-based secrecy methods are employed to achieve confidential transmission. For the purpose of superior secrecy performance, the scheme combining big data driven cluster and OBF, each of which can configure limited communication resources agilely and effectively in a dynamically changing network environment, is proposed. As the number of authorized users increases in the system, not only the channel vectors of cluster heads can tend to match with beamforming vectors with a high probability, but also more authorized users can be added into clusters and attain confidential content. These advantages ensure the combination of these two techniques is an attractive approach to transmit confidential message at a high rate. Based on different demand cases, multiple versions of the scheme combining cluster and OBF are put forward. In order to validate our proposed schemes, numerical simulations are carried out and the results show that a significant performance gain over both the average secrecy sum-capacity and the average number of authorized users accessing the system is achieved.},

The parent organisation owns all the confidential information about users but the collaborative organisation has to verify users' identities and access rights to allow access to their services and resources. This challenge involves resolving how to communicate users' identities to collaborative organisations without sending their confidential information. Several generic Identity and Access Management (IAM) standards have been proposed, and three have become established standards: Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), Open Authentication (OAuth), and OpenID Connect (OIDC). Mobile computing and communication have some specific requirements and limitations; therefore, this paper evaluates these IAM standards to ascertain suitable IAM to protect mobile computing and communication.

Considering edge nodes with the limited ability of processing, the small-scale compressive DL model is applicatively deployed into them. However, the model can expose the privacy of training dataset. Thus, the model should be regarded as confidential due to the sensitive training dataset when applied in commercial and security fields. In this paper, we design a deep-learning-based service provision system for protecting the privacy and enhancing services in edge computing. We propose a practical approach for building the private compressive DL model by incorporating differential privacy mechanism on the cloud server side. For protecting the privacy of training dataset, the approach is composed of the private dense training step and the private compressive training step, where differential privacy is used to construct the private pre-trained dense model and the private compressive model, respectively. The private compressive model with 1/9 of the dense model's size can be practically embedded into edge servers. Edge servers provide enhanced services to the near IoT devices. Finally, we mainly execute a set of experiments on MNIST dataset. Compared to the dense model with no privacy constraints and with differential privacy (train and test accuracies of 98.0\% and 98.2\%, 95.5\%, and 97.2\%, respectively), the private compressive model perturbation with (6, 10-5)-differential privacy (train and test accuracies of 96.3\% and 95.8\%) can achieve high utility while upholding tight privacy.},

Nevertheless, due to the open feature of the wireless offloading channels and the high mobility of the vehicles, the security and stability of the offloading process would be seriously degraded. In this paper, by utilizing the physical layer security (PLS) technique and spectrum sharing architecture, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based joint secure offloading and resource allocation (SORA) scheme to improve the secrecy performance and resource efficiency of the multi-user VEC networks, where the VU offloading links share the frequency spectrum preoccupied with the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication links. We use Wyner’s wiretap coding scheme to obtain the achievable secrecy rate and guarantee that confidential information cannot be decoded by multiple mobile eavesdroppers. We aim at minimizing the system processing delay while securing the wireless offloading process, by jointly optimizing the transmit power, the frequency spectrum selection and the computation resource allocation. We formulate the optimization problem as a multi-agent collaborative optimal decision problem and solve it with a double deep Q-learning algorithm. Besides, we set a punishment mechanism for the rate degradation to guarantee the communication quality of each V2V link. Simulation results demonstrate that multiple VU agents adopting the SORA scheme can rapidly adapt to the highly dynamic VEC networks and cooperate to improve the system delay performance while increasing the secrecy probability.},

	abstract = {Data provenance, the origin and derivation history of data, is commonly used for security auditing, forensics and data analysis. While provenance loggers provide evidence of data changes, the integrity of the provenance logs is also critical for the integrity of the forensics process. However, to our best knowledge, few solutions are able to fully satisfy this trust requirement. In this paper, we propose a framework to enable tamper-evidence and preserve the confidentiality and integrity of data provenance using the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Our framework also stores provenance logs in trusted and backup servers to guarantee the availability of data provenance. Tampered provenance logs can be discovered and consequently recovered by retrieving the original logs from the servers. Leveraging on TPM's technical capability, our framework guarantees data provenance collected to be admissible, complete, and confidential. More importantly, this framework can be applied to capture tampering evidence in large-scale cloud environments at system, network, and application granularities. We applied our framework to provide tamper-evidence for Progger, a cloud-based, kernel-space logger. Our results demonstrate the ability to conduct remote attestation of Progger logs' integrity, and uphold the completeness, confidential and admissible requirements.},

The peer to peer applications use in the robotic platforms for threats target integrity, availability and confidential security purposes. A Remote Administration Tool (RAT) was introduced for specific security attacks. An impact oriented process was performed for analyzing the assessment outcomes of the attacks. Tests and experiments of attacks were performed in simulation environment which was based on Gazbo Turtlebot simulator and physically on the robot. A software tool was used for simulating, debugging and experimenting on ROS platform. Integrity attacks performed for modifying commands and manipulated the robot behavior. Availability attacks were affected for Denial-of-Service (DoS) and the robot was not listened to Turtlebot commands. Integrity and availability attacks resulted sensitive information on the robot.},

	abstract = {Today retail businesses expect to bring the utmost in sales and payment transactions by adapting new technologies. Therefore, Advanced Point of Sales (PoS) Systems are widely used in the industry. Regardless of how efficient and secure these systems or applications work, unexpected information security risks can arise. Such risks could be a threat to their business and organization. It is important to ensure that critical information such as payment card information, handled in PoS systems is kept secure from attacks that could bring financial loss. This research provides a solution by studying the overall infrastructure of a PoS System and identifies the key events that such data would be at risk. The major concern of it was to enhance the existing security features of the system to avoid any type of malicious activity. This research consists of four main sections under security related to PoS Systems that would address the risk; Studying of malware and classifying them, detecting possible attacks and means of preventing it, a robot (BOT) to predict and generate the system status with a Data Leakage Prevention(DLP) solution for all the events occurring at a PoS. The key objective of implementing this solution was to protect the confidential data that is being used in the PoS System and to avoid threats that lead to the unavailability of the system. The implemented security features using machine learning and Deep Learning methods to the existing PoS functions produced a 99.3\% of accuracy in Malware Detection and 95\% of accuracy in its Classification process while the DLP Solution was able to obtain an accuracy of 84.6\%. The above results retrieved fulfilled the research objectives and aided to integrate an enhanced security solution for a PoS system.},

Since fog computing originates from and is a non-trivial extension of cloud computing, it inherits many security and privacy challenges of cloud computing, causing the extensive concerns in the research community. To enable authentic and confidential communications among a group of fog nodes, in this paper, we propose an efficient key exchange protocol based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) to establish secure communications among the participants. To achieve confidentiality, authentication, verifiability, and access control, we combine CP-ABE and digital signature techniques. We analyze the efficiency of our protocol in terms of security and performance. We also implement our protocol and compare it with the certificate-based scheme to illustrate its feasibility.},

	abstract = {We investigate the problem of secure communications in a Gaussian multiway relay channel applying the compute-and-forward scheme under usage of nested lattice codes. All nodes employ half-duplex operation and can exchange confidential messages only via an untrusted relay. The relay is assumed to be honest but curious, i.e., an eavesdropper that conforms to the system rules and applies the intended relaying scheme. We start with the general case of the single-input multiple-output L-user multiway relay channel and provide an achievable secrecy rate region under a weak secrecy criterion. We show that the securely achievable sum rate is equivalent to the difference between the computation rate and the multiple access channel (MAC) capacity. In particular, we show that all nodes must encode their messages such that the common computation rate tuple falls outside the MAC capacity region of the relay. We provide results for the single-input single-output and the multiple-input single-input L-user multiway relay channel as well as the two-way relay channel. We discuss these results and show the dependence between channel realization and achievable secrecy rate. We further compare our result to available results in the literature for different schemes and show that the proposed scheme operates close to the compute-and-forward rate without secrecy.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely applied for service provisioning in many domains, such as topographic mapping and traffic monitoring. These applications are complicated with huge computational resources and extremely low-latency requirements. However, the moderate computational capability and limited energy restrict the local data processing for the UAV. Fortunately, this impediment may be mitigated by utilizing wireless power transfer (WPT) and employing the multiaccess edge computing (MEC) paradigm for offloading demanding computational tasks from the UAV via wireless communications. Particularly, the offloaded information may become compromising by the eavesdropper (Eve) when UAVs offload the computational tasks to MEC servers. To address this issue, a UAV-MEC (UMEC) system with energy harvesting (EH) is studied, where the full-duplex protocol is considered to realize simultaneously receiving confidential data from the UAV and broadcasting the control instructions. It is worth noting that in our proposed scheme, these control instructions also serve as the artificial interference to confuse the Eve. To improve the energy efficiency for offloading, the computational communication resource allocation is optimized to minimize the energy consumption for UAV with the consumed and harvested energy. Specially, the worst case secrecy offloading rate and computation-latency constraint are considered, to further enhance the reliability and security of the proposed system. Since the objective optimization problem is nonconvex, we convert it into a convex one by analytical means. The semiclosed form expressions of the offloading time, offloading data size, and transmit power are, respectively, derived. Moreover, the conditions of nonoffloading, partial, and full offloading are also discussed from a physical perspective. With the specific conditions of activating the above-mentioned three offloading options, numerical results verify the performance of our proposed offloading strategy in various scenarios and show the superiority of our offloading strategy with the existing works in terms of the offloading capacity and energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {The advent of high performance fog and edge computing and high bandwidth connectivity has brought about changes to Internet-of-Things (IoT) service architectures, allowing for greater quantities of high quality information to be extracted from their environments to be processed. However, recently introduced international regulations, along with heightened awareness among consumers, have strengthened requirements to ensure data security, with significant financial and reputational penalties for organisations who fail to protect customers' data. This paper proposes the leveraging of fog and edge computing to facilitate processing of confidential user data, to reduce the quantity and availability of raw confidential data at various levels of the IoT architecture. This ultimately reduces attack surface area, however it also increases efficiency of the architecture by distributing processing amongst nodes and transmitting only processed data. However, such an approach is vulnerable to device level attacks. To approach this issue, a proposed System Security Manager is used to continuously monitor system resources and ensure confidential data is confined only to parts of the device that require it. In event of an attack, critical data can be isolated and the system informed, to prevent data confidentiality breach.},

The goal of this study is to implement an effective and safe proactive strategy (instead of sending a response of a query to each node, node should have its own local computational resources that updates the parameter to the central server) on edge devices which will provide more privacy, as personal data are processed at the nearest edge that can be leaked or exploited by any intruder and because of latency problem in the centralized approach there is a need for effective decentralized system, which additionally should give better outcome as off-base outcome can at some point be calamitous, like in the case of auto-driving car. We will also be presenting how we can utilize numerous encryption technique to scramble data for model training which regardless of whether get hacked by an intruder would be of no use, as if confidential data learned by the model or leaked to an intruder might lead to a significant loss. The proposed method would be tested to all the machine learning problems like word suggestion, image classification and many more.},

However, current cloud-based inference services operate on clear inputs and NN models, raising paramount privacy concerns. Individual user data may contain private information that should always remain confidential. Meanwhile, the NN model is deemed proprietary to the model owner as model training requires substantial resources. In this article, we present, tailor, and evaluate Sonic, a lightweight secure NN inference service delegated in the cloud. Sonic leverages the cloud computing paradigm to fully outsource the secure inference, freeing end devices and model owners from being actively online for assistance. Sonic guards both user input and model privacy along the whole service flow. We design a series of secure and efficient NN layer functions purely using lightweight cryptographic primitives. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Sonic achieves up to 60{\textbackslash}times60× bandwidth saving in online inference compared to prior art.},

For this, organizations enforce physical, logical, and administrative controls to protect their information from being corrupted, manipulated, or leaked. However, some organizations are unaware that some employees, with little awareness of cybersecurity threats, are an easy target for attackers. Nowadays, companies implement security awareness using policies, procedures, and training sessions, to list a few. Traditional information security training sessions have relied heavily on presentation slides and videos. This paper aims to improve the employees' security awareness by developing an interactive video game, Cyber Shield Game, which includes various embedded threat scenarios. The proposed game consists of two levels. The Password Complexity Level trains players about password threats. The Physical Security Level aware the employees about storage and disposal of confidential documents. Further, two surveys, pre and post-game, are conducted to estimate the players' knowledge and experience level in cybersecurity threats. The proposed security awareness program is applied to ten employees randomly chosen from different institutions. Experimental results indicate that a security awareness program is more interactive than traditional awareness methods. Results also indicate that the proposed program improves the employees' security awareness level by 51\%.},

Consumer digital twins, i.e., the digital replica of a consumer, can be important in the industrial Metaverse, since multiple sales strategies, consumer engagement interventions, and advertising campaigns can be tested on consumer DT before an actual intervention, significantly increasing business efficiency and profits. A consumer DT may involve multi-dimensional dynamic real-time data (e.g., location and behavioral data) which requires assistance via the IoT devices (such as wearables and mobile phones). However, some information regarding consumers is confidential and private. In this paper, we propose a edge-based privacy-preserving training framework for developing consumer DTs. In particular, a global pre-trained consumer DT is placed at some edge clouds which linked to multiple base stations (BS). Wireless devices that provide confidential consumer data can download the model, finetune it with local data, and transmit updated model parameters to the edge server via a selected BS. The parameters of the consumer DT are to be aggregated at the edge cloud hosting the global consumer DT and the timing of update is affected by the network congestion. We adopt evolutionary game to model the opportunistic BS selection behavior of the IoT devices. Extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analysis show that in the long-term a equilibrium point can be achieved.},

	abstract = {The protection of confidential data (e.g., personal data) is a concern of increasing importance. Data processing applications are often deployed in cloud or fog/edge computing systems. Such cloud-based systems may change dynamically during operations, for example because of changes in the users, in the deployed software services, or in the infrastructure. As a result, both the threats to data protection and the availability of data protection mechanisms may change at run time, making efficient data protection very challenging. This paper presents RADAR (Run-time Adaptations for DAta pRotection), an approach for ensuring data protection in dynamically changing cloud-based systems. RADAR analyzes the configuration of the cloud-based system automatically at run time, to detect changes in the threats to data protection or in the availability of data protection mechanisms. If needed, RADAR automatically adapts the cloud-based system to ensure the continued satisfaction of data protection requirements. From multiple possible adaptations that lead to the satisfaction of data protection requirements, RADAR chooses an adaptation that has the lowest negative implication on other goals, like costs and the availability of functionality. RADAR is a comprehensive approach that combines pattern-based detection of problematic system configurations with model-based automatic run-time adaptations and a search algorithm for finding the best adaptation. RADAR is validated using two case studies from the cloud and fog computing domains, and the scalability of the approach is evaluated using a set of controlled experiments.},

	abstract = {The expand trend of cloud data mobility led to malicious data threats that necessitate using data protection techniques. Most cloud system applications contain valuable and confidential data, such as personal, trade, or health information. Threats on such data may put the cloud systems that hold these data at high risk. However, traditional security solutions are not capable of handling the security of big data mobility. The current security mechanisms are insufficient for big data due to their shortage of determining the data that should be protected or due to their intractable time complexity. Therefore, the demand for securing mobile big data has been increasing rapidly to avoid any potential risks. This paper proposes an integrated methodology to classify and secure big data before executing data mobility, duplication, and analysis. The necessity of securing big data mobility is determined by classifying the data according to the risk impact level of their contents into two categories; confidential and public. Based on the classification category, the impact of data security is studied and substantiated on the confidential data in the scope of Hadoop Distributed File System. It is revealed that the proposed approach can significantly improve the cloud systems data mobility.},

	abstract = {Healthcare data is increasingly being digitized today and the data collected today coming in from all modern devices, has reached a significant volume all over the world. In the US, UK and other European countries, healthcare data needs to be secured and Patient Health Records (PHR) need to be protected so that re-identification of patients cannot be done from basic information. Privacy of healthcare is an important aspect governed by Healthcare Acts (e.g. HIPAA) and hence the data needs to be secured from falling into the wrong hands or from being breached by malicious insiders. It is important to secure existing healthcare big data environments due to increasing threats of breaches and leaks from confidential data and increased adoption of cloud technologies. In this paper the current healthcare security scenario in big data environments has been summarized along with challenges faced and security issues that need attention. Some existing approaches have been described to illustrate current and standard directions to solving the issues. Since healthcare governance in the US has a strong focus on security and privacy as opposed to other countries on this day, the paper focuses on Acts and privacy practices in the US context.},

	doi = {10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229903},
	abstract = {With the growing number of mobile applications, secure storage of information is essential. A strong encryption system is required to protect the data stored in android phones at a maximum level. Traditional encryption schemes have the disadvantage that communication overheads and the computation costs are too high. And also there is a possibility that the data is lost after encryption. Hence, it is necessary to implement a “Data Encryption and Decryption” scheme with “Cloud Backup” feature which is more efficient in order to provide high level of data security for android phones. It is necessary to create means which will enable a user to encrypt confidential data present in the mobile phones. Decrypt it to recover the encrypted data. In case of brute force attack, user need not worry about losing the data as “Automatic encryption” is triggered. “Cloud Backup” is another mechanism to prevent the data from being known by an adversary. This paper proposes an Android Application which will provide the features of automatic encryption, data encryption/decryption, and cloud backup all in one single mobile application. AES -256 bit algorithm is used for this purpose. The sole purpose of using AES for encryption/decryption is that it is secure and has high computational complexity. Due to this the intruder will require comparatively more time to decrypt the data.},

	doi = {10.1109/CCGrid49817.2020.00-52},
	abstract = {Countries across the globe have been pushing strict regulations on the protection of personal or private data collected. The traditional centralized machine learning method, where data is collected from end-users or IoT devices, so that it can discover insights behind real-world data, may not be feasible for many data-driven industry applications in light of such regulations. A new machine learning method, coined by Google as Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple participants to train a machine learning model collectively without directly exchanging data. However, recent studies have shown that there is still a possibility to exploit the shared models to extract personal or confidential data. In this paper, we propose to adopt Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to achieve privacy-preserving model aggregation for FL. The MPC-enabled model aggregation in a peer-to-peer manner incurs high communication overhead with low scalability. To address this problem, the authors proposed to develop a two-phase mechanism by 1) electing a small committee and 2) providing MPC-enabled model aggregation service to a larger number of participants through the committee. The MPC-enabled FL framework has been integrated in an IoT platform for smart manufacturing. It enables a set of companies to train high quality models collectively by leveraging their complementary data-sets on their own premises, without compromising privacy, model accuracy vis-a`-vis traditional machine learning methods and execution efficiency in terms of communication cost and execution time.},

The deterministic access authenticates certainty of the information collected and deposited. The main aim of this project is to certify the accuracy of the outsourced frequent item set mining as a prototype of service. The data of a particular item is warehoused in local mining and third party mining. This correctness of the data is substantiated by equating the outcome of the local mining and the third party mining. If the data is not same, then it is considered that the data is altered. To overcome this problem, the forms that are being sent to third party for obtaining the results, should be different. This will make sure that the third party results are not manipulated.},

Internet of Things (IoT) can be considered as a connection of computing devices like smart phones, coffee maker, washing machines, wearable device with an internet. IoT create network and connect "things" and people together by creating relationship between either people-people, people-things or things-things.

Furthermore, privacy and data sharing can again be considered as a security concern for IoT. Companies, those who use IoT technique, need to find a way to store, track, analyze and make sense of the large amounts of data that will be generated. Few security techniques of IoT are necessary to implement to protect your confidential and important data as well for device protection through some internet security threats.},

However, current architectural concepts for personalization are either impractical or cannot support both sides without leaking sensitive data, namely the user's personal data or the provider's protected ML models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach termed EdgeBox for ad hoc personalizing nearby IoT applications while allowing both, (1) keeping the providers' ML models confidential and (2) privacy-preserving processing of personal user data, even on untrusted IoT devices. In short, confidential parts of the EdgeBox (e.g., the personalization task) are performed in an isolated trusted execution environment (TEE) within the IoT device's processor; the remote attested code in the TEE allows to confidentially load latest provider models and stream the required user data over wireless direct link ad-hoc protocol on demand. We evaluate our implemented proof-of-concept prototype (ad-hoc-initialized vs. pre-initialized) w.r.t. setup time and performance overhead. The results show real-time capabilities with an acceptable overhead, enabling a novel and confidential way to ad hoc personalize a user's dynamic environment in everyday life, supporting several assistant use cases.},

Risk-based authentication, a form of multi factor authentication adapts itself according to the risk profile of the users. This paper puts forth the design of risk engine integrated with the system to examine the user's past login records and generate a suitable pattern using machine learning algorithms to calculate the risk level of the user. The risk level further decides the authentication method that the user will be challenged with. Thus the adaptive authentication model helps in providing a higher level of security to its users.},

However, existing RingCT protocols are instantiated from one-out-of-many proofs with only one secret, leading to low efficiency and weak anonymity when handling transactions with multiple inputs. Additionally, current partial knowledge proofs with multiple secrets are neither secure nor efficient to be applied in a RingCT protocol.In this paper, we propose a novel any-out-of-many proof, a logarithmic-sized zero-knowledge proof scheme for showing the knowledge of arbitrarily many secrets out of a public list. Unlike other partial knowledge proofs that have to reveal the number of secrets [ACF21], our approach proves the knowledge of multiple secrets without leaking the exact number of them. Furthermore, we improve the efficiency of our method with a generic inner-product transformation to adopt the Bulletproofs compression [BBB+18], which reduces the proof size to 2⌈log2(N)⌉+9.Based on our proposed proof scheme, we further construct a compact RingCT protocol for privacy cryptocurrencies, which can provide a logarithmic-sized communication complexity for transactions with multiple inputs. More importantly, as the only known RingCT protocol instantiated from the partial knowledge proofs, our protocol can achieve the highest anonymity level compared with other approaches like Omniring [LRR+19]. For other applications, such as multiple ring signatures, our protocol can also be applied with some modifications. We believe our techniques are also applicable in other privacy-preserving scenarios, such as multiple ring signatures and coin-mixing in the blockchain.},

The multiple eavesdroppers may overhear the confidential task offloading, which leads to information leakage. In order to address this issue, we present the minimization problem of the secrecy outage probability (SOP), by jointly taking into account the constraints from the latency and energy consumption. With the aim to improve the system secrecy performance, we then introduce three user selection criteria to choose the best user among multiple ones. Specifically, \textit{criterion I} maximizes the locally computational capacity, while \textit{criterion II} and \textit{III} maximize the secrecy capacity and data rate of main links, respectively. For these criteria, we further analyze the system secrecy performance by deriving analytical and asymptotic expressions for the SOP, from which we can conclude important insights for the system design. Finally, simulation and analytical results are provided to verify the proposed analysis. The results show that the three criteria can efficiently safeguard the MEC networks, compared to the traditional local computing and fully offloading, especially with a large value of user number.},

The key protection point of this system is that it encrypts the file and then stores it in the cloud storage which makes the database secure, as only encrypted files are stored. The decryption of a file is done only when the authorized individual accesses it with a unique key provided by the sender. For detection, after every successful transfer, the counter of successful transfer is increased which shows the success rate of the web app, and every case of data leakage is also prevented and detected and recorded creating a threat-free environment.},

	abstract = {By providing a function called Cloud Storage, the company let participants outsource their confidential data to a third party and use the on-demand services and applications of data on the organization's cloud storage server. With this, researchers would be able to encrypt details, which would will be crucial in preventing security breaches of confidential details. In this exchange conference, businesses have to encrypt their data before they process it to the Cloud framework. Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) system is a symmetric key dependent cryptosystem used in cloud system that lets device users, software, data and programmers access managed digital data. Unfortunately, BAE suffers from a performance downside with outsourcing the operation of decrypting the secret. There has been a lot of suggestions put forward as to how to boost the performance of the method. It would be to the same investigation that was stated in the research study. We take the case of the Robust Paraphrasing and conclude there is a new implementation of the Electronic Referencing tool, even though it depends on the Actuals. The load testing strategy is used to minimize the expense of outsourcing the decryption phase to a third-party data decryption service provider. Load balancing may occur by considering features such as file space, memory, hard drive disc usage, etc. For the intent of revocation of key for a community, we often discuss the problem of the key consumer quitting the group. Therefore, in the case of the key user leaving the group, the latest key to open a group should be modified and circulated to all current key holders. The experimental findings of this proposed method proves that the time and memory consumptions of this proposed system were comparable to, if not higher than, the current system of time consumptions and memory usage.},

	abstract = {The widespread acceptance of cloud based services in the healthcare sector has resulted in cost effective and convenient exchange of Personal Health Records (PHRs) among several participating entities of the e-Health systems. Nevertheless, storing the confidential health information to cloud servers is susceptible to revelation or theft and calls for the development of methodologies that ensure the privacy of the PHRs. Therefore, we propose a methodology called SeSPHR for secure sharing of the PHRs in the cloud. The SeSPHR scheme ensures patient-centric control on the PHRs and preserves the confidentiality of the PHRs. The patients store the encrypted PHRs on the un-trusted cloud servers and selectively grant access to different types of users on different portions of the PHRs. A semi-trusted proxy called Setup and Re-encryption Server (SRS) is introduced to set up the public/private key pairs and to produce the re-encryption keys. Moreover, the methodology is secure against insider threats and also enforces a forward and backward access control. Furthermore, we formally analyze and verify the working of SeSPHR methodology through the High Level Petri Nets (HLPN). Performance evaluation regarding time consumption indicates that the SeSPHR methodology has potential to be employed for securely shar-ing the PHRs in the cloud.},

	abstract = {Data produced by end devices like smartphones, sensors or IoT devices can be stored and processed across a continuum of compute resources, from end devices via fog nodes to the cloud, enabling reduced latency, increased processing speed and energy savings. However, the data may be sensitive (e.g., personal data or confidential commercially sensitive information), with regulatory or other requirements for its protection. Protecting sensitive data in the dynamic, heterogeneous, and decentralized cloud-to-edge continuum is very challenging. This paper describes a solution: FogProtect, an integrated set of four technologies to protect data in the cloud-to-edge continuum. Fog-Protect addresses four concerns: (i) control and enforcement of distributed data access and usage; (ii) management of distributed data protection policies; (iii) risk assessment for data assets in the cloud-to-edge continuum; (iv) automated optimisation and adaptation to address identified risks. FogProtect operates dynamically, reacting to system changes or detected vulnerabilities to keep the data secure across the cloud- to-edge continuum. This paper describes an overview of the FogProtect concept, discusses each of the four approaches, and illustrates their usage for the protection of data in three real-world use cases.},

We pose the problem as that of network utility maximization, into which confidentiality is incorporated as an additional quality of service constraint. We develop a simple, and yet provably optimal dynamic control algorithm that combines flow control, routing and end-to-end secrecy-encoding. In order to achieve confidentiality, our scheme exploits multipath diversity and temporal diversity due to channel variability. Our end-to-end dynamic encoding scheme encodes confidential messages across multiple packets, to be combined at the ultimate destination for recovery. We first develop an optimal dynamic policy for the case in which the number of blocks across which secrecy encoding is performed is asymptotically large. Next, we consider encoding across a finite number of packets, which eliminates the possibility of achieving perfect secrecy. For this case, we develop a dynamic policy to choose the encoding rates for each message, based on the instantaneous channel state information, queue states and secrecy outage requirements. By numerical analysis, we observe that the proposed scheme approaches the optimal rates asymptotically with increasing block size. Finally, we address the consequences of practical implementation issues such as infrequent queue updates and de-centralized scheduling. We demonstrate the efficacy of our policies by numerical studies under various network conditions.},

	abstract = {As a very appealing computing standard, cloud computing makes it feasible for resource constrained clients to experience rate effective and flexible resources at ease. In the prevailing systems, the conventional cloud storage scheme is bound to operate its primitive functions in centralized mode. This reason possess problems like data availability, information protection and excessive operational charge. With the improvement of block chain generation, the decentralized scheme has entered the general public view. Compared to contemporary and cutting edge cloud storage, they are predicted to be more scalable, secured and comfortable. But, the use of end-to-end encryption in a decentralized scheme, limits the search functionality as the existing searchable encryption methods are designed only for the centralized device. Moreover, the existing decentralized cloud storage doesn't restrict any data user to get access to all of the files for any keyword search made purposefully through them. Thus, in this manner, user integrity of files and keyword searches are compromised throughout the network. Therefore, as a manner to solve these complications, we systematically join techniques of encryption and hashing to furnish reliable keyword search over encrypted files in decentralized storage. Consequently using the block chain system, the architecture remains incorruptible and protects all the confidential files and keywords in a fully controlled file access environment.},

Ring Confidential Transaction (RingCT) protocol is widely used in anonymous cryptocurrencies (e.g. Monero) to hide transaction information. However, its expensive computing and storage costs slow down the performance of the system. In this work, we propose a high-efficient RingCT protocol which is called aggregation ring confidential transaction (ARCT). In our protocol, we build a compact aggregation proof for multiple accounts of the sender, which enables our protocol to linearly shorten the signature size compared to other protocols. In addition, in order to further protect the privacy information, we first implement hiding the amount of the sender's accounts. Our protocol can provide cryptocurrencies with better privacy protection and lower resource cost. Besides, it does not require a trust setting. For a typical n=2 input transaction with the ring size of 128, the signature size of our protocol is 93\% less than it used in the original protocol. ARCT build on the techniques of inner product optimization algorithm and cryptographic accumulators. We show that our underlying algorithm satisfies the security under the random oracle model.},

This development poses a challenge to traditional FPGA security models, as these are assuming trust between the user and the hardware owner. Currently, the user cannot keep bitstream nor data protected from the hardware owner in an FPGA-as-a-service setting. This paper proposes a security model where the chip manufacturer takes the role of root-of-trust to remedy these security problems. We suggest that the chip manufacturer creates a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), used for user bitstream protection and data encryption, on each device. The chip manufacturer, rather than the hardware owner, also controls certain security-related peripherals. This allows the user to take control over a predefined part of the programmable logic and set up a protected enclave area. Hence, all user data can be provided in encrypted form and only be revealed inside the enclave area. In addition, our model enables secure and concurrent multi-tenant usage of remote FPGAs. To also consider the needs of the hardware owner, our solution includes bitstream certification and affirming that uploaded bitstreams have been vetted against maliciousness.},

Such easy access undoubtedly carries with it a concern about the secrecy of the information which is conveyed to outsiders. Records may likewise be leaked by the concerned members. A direct arrangement for the client to encode all reports prior to submitting them is essential.

It utilizes the data nearby the users to provide real-time, energy-efficient, and reliable services. Neural network inference in edge computing is a powerful tool for various applications. However, edge server will collect more personal sensitive information of users inevitably. It is the most basic requirement for users to ensure their security and privacy while obtaining accurate inference results. Homomorphic encryption (HE) technology is confidential computing that directly performs mathematical computing on encrypted data. But it only can carry out limited addition and multiplication operation with very low efficiency. Intel software guard extension (SGX) can provide a trusted isolation space in the CPU to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of code and data executed. But several defects are hard to overcome due to hardware design limitations when applying SGX in inference services. This paper proposes a hybrid framework utilizing SGX to accelerate the HE-based convolutional neural network (CNN) inference, eliminating the approximation operations in HE to improve inference accuracy in theory. Besides, SGX is also taken as a built-in trusted third party to distribute keys, thereby improving our framework's scalability and flexibility. We have quantified the various CNN operations in the respective cases of HE and SGX to provide the foresight practice. Taking the connected and autonomous vehicles as a case study in edge computing, we implemented this hybrid framework in CNN to verify its feasibility and advantage.},

Cloud has the massive storage, computational power and software which can be used by clients for reducing their computational overhead and storage limitation.

We have designed a protocol for outsourcing large scale Eigen value problem to a malicious cloud which provides input/output data security, result verifiability and client's efficiency. As the direct computation method to find all eigenvectors is computationally expensive for large dimensionality, we have used power iterative method for finding the largest Eigen value and the corresponding Eigen vector of a matrix. For protecting the privacy, some transformations are applied to the input matrix to get encrypted matrix which is sent to the cloud and then decrypting the result that is returned from the cloud for getting the correct solution of Eigen value problem. We have also proposed result verification mechanism for detecting robust cheating and provided theoretical analysis and experimental result that describes high-efficiency, correctness, security and robust cheating resistance of the proposed protocol.},

	abstract = {The rapid development and wide application of blockchain not only highlight the significance of privacy protection (including anonymity and confidentiality) but also the necessity of auditability. While several ingenious schemes such as MiniLedger and traceable Monero supporting both privacy protection and auditability have been proposed, they either provide incomplete privacy protection (only achieving anonymity within a small set or only providing confidentiality but not anonymity), or involve additional auditing conditions such as reaching threshold transaction volume or requiring permissioned nodes to serve as the manager, or restrict to specific blockchain types such as Monero. To mitigate these issues, this article proposes a generic anonymous, confidential, and auditable transaction system (named ACA), which is compatible with both UTXO-based permissionless and permissioned blockchains. Core technologies of ACA include designed traceable anonymous key generation and publicly verifiable authorization mechanisms from existing cryptographic tools (i.e., public key encryption, partially homomorphic encryption, and accumulator) as well as the meticulous designed signatures of knowledge and smart contract. To demonstrate the entity of our proposal, we first prove its security including authenticity, anonymity, confidentiality and soundness, and then provide an instantiation to evaluate its performance. The final implementation and benchmarks show that our proposal can still gain performance advantage even adding more functionalities.},

	abstract = {Firewall is the critical first line of defense against cyber attacks. In order to improve security and performance, modern enterprises have to deploy and manage their own firewalls. But the firewall infrastructure is expensive and complex to manage, thus enterprises begin to outsource their firewalls to the cloud to reduce firewall management and deployment costs. The current firewall outsourcing schemes require enterprises to fully trust the cloud. However, firewall policies are confidential information of enterprises, and enterprises do not want to reveal them to the cloud. Such privacy issues hinder the adoption of cloud-based firewall service. With the development of cloud computing, more and more enterprises migrate their IT systems to the cloud (we call these enterprises the IaaS-based enterprises). In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving firewall outsourcing scheme for a new architecture, in which an IaaS-based enterprise outsources its firewall policies to another cloud. We implement a prototype of our scheme and the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our scheme.},

	abstract = {As an important application of the Internet of Things, many remote monitoring systems adopt a device-to-cloud network paradigm. In a remote patient monitoring case, various resource-constrained devices are used to measure the health conditions of a target patient in a distant non-clinical environment and the collected data are sent to the cloud backend of an authorized health care service for processing and decision making. As the measurements involve private patient information, access control and trustworthy processing of the confidential data become very important. Software-based solutions that adopt advanced cryptographic tools, such as attribute-based encryption and fully homomorphic encryption, can address the problem, but they also impose substantial computation overhead on both client and server sides. In this paper, we deviate from the conventional software-based solutions and propose a secure and efficient remote monitoring framework, called SRM, using the latest hardware-based trustworthy computing technology, such as Intel SGX. In addition, we present a robust and lightweight “heartbeat” protocol to handle notoriously difficult key revocation problem. We implemented a prototype of the framework for SRM and show that SRM can protect user data privacy against unauthorized parties, with minimum performance cost compared to existing software-based solutions.},

Currently, most digital service providers and organizations are actively working on metaverse- based applications. In addition, there has been a rapid increase on research work involving metaverse realization. Launching a large scale metaverse in the real world is a challenging task. However, fifth-generation (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) technologies are envisioned to improve the feasibility of pragmatic deployments. Although, there are several conceptual designs available, actual adaptations of the concepts are still limited. This survey focuses on providing a practical approach for metaverse realization using 5G and B5G technologies. Specifically, We discuss the importance of network slicing (NS) and multi-access edge computing (MEC) as emerging 5G technologies for enabling the realization of the metaverse. We first introduce the motivation behind metaverse for future envisaged technologies. Next, we present a holistic high-level framework for metaverse realization based on network slicing and edge computing. Moreover, we discuss the futuristic metaverse applications, their technical requirements, and methods to satisfy the requirements. Finally, we highlight the deployment challenges and possible approaches to overcome them for an actual metaverse realization.},

Cyber security can also be considered as a subset of information security because information security is a general term. It aims to protect a wider domain which includes all kinds of information assets either hard copy or soft copy. The recent accelerating rise in digitalization due to Covid-19 has brought in many new challenges. The amount of personal data present on the web due to the same has raised concerns among users. However, it's not only the personal data that is a matter of concern but also the dataset which is given as input to numerous machine learning and deep learning models. Local networks are prone to attacks and intrusion activities now more than ever. As a result, cyber security experts have been working on the development of more complex monitoring systems and algorithms for the detection and prevention of such activities. Various technologies like machine learning and deep learning might play a significant role in improving cyber security. It can help in analyzing patterns and improving the models for recognizing similar attacks in future. This research work aims to study intrusion detection systems in detail and differentiate between intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems and firewalls as IDS and IPS are commonly regarded as the same thing. It also highlights the previous works related to this subject along with their suggested methods.},

Towards this, we present a Cloud-based data provenance framework using Blockchain, which traces data record operations and generates provenance data.

The application creates a cloud storage application for the students and faculty of the university, thereby making the storage and sharing of work and resources efficient.

In this paper, we present a phrase search technique based on Bloom filters that is significantly faster than existing solutions, with similar or better storage and communication cost. Our technique uses a series of n-gram filters to support the functionality. The scheme exhibits a trade-off between storage and false positive rate, and is adaptable to defend against inclusion-relation attacks. A design approach based on an application's target false positive rate is also described.},

	abstract = {Temporary keyword search on confidential data in a cloud environment is the main focus of this research. The cloud providers are not fully trusted. So, it is necessary to outsource data in the encrypted form. In the attribute-based keyword search (ABKS) schemes, the authorized users can generate some search tokens and send them to the cloud for running the search operation. These search tokens can be used to extract all the ciphertexts which are produced at any time and contain the corresponding keyword. Since this may lead to some information leakage, it is more secure to propose a scheme in which the search tokens can only extract the ciphertexts generated in a specified time interval. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive called key-policy attribute-based temporary keyword search (KP-ABTKS) which provide this property. To evaluate the security of our scheme, we formally prove that our proposed scheme achieves the keyword secrecy property and is secure against selectively chosen keyword attack (SCKA) both in the random oracle model and under the hardness of Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. Furthermore, we show that the complexity of the encryption algorithm is linear with respect to the number of the involved attributes. Performance evaluation shows our scheme's practicality.},

Many organizations and companies attempted to mine the data with cloud computing. However, given the rise of various privacy issues, sensitive data (e.g., medical records) need to be encrypted before outsourcing to the cloud. To process data mining, such as the ID3 algorithm, over encrypted data without the cloud decrypting the data is a very challenging task. In this paper, we consider a scenario where multiple parties with weak computational power need to run an ID3 algorithm on their databases jointly and outsource most of the computation of the protocol and databases to the cloud. In this scenario, each party can have the correct result calculated by the data from all of the parties with most of the computation outsourced to the cloud. For privacy, the data owned by each party should be kept confidential from both the other parties and the cloud. To ensure data privacy, we use an efficient homomorphic encryption scheme with multiple keys and design an Outsourced Secure Shared xlnx Protocol (OSSxlnx). We then propose a cloud-aided ID3 solution that is used to build an outsourced privacy-preserving ID3 data mining solution.},

Quantum computing, another emerging technological paradigm, promises novel compute opportunities but is also able to compromise cybersecurity ciphers. Therefore, improved methods to mitigate such security threats are needed. In this research, we propose a location-aware cryptographic system that guarantees post-quantum IoT security. The ultimate value of a location-driven cryptosystem is to use the geographic location as a player’s identity and credential. Position-driven cryptography using lattices is efficient and lightweight, and it can be used to protect sensitive and confidential data in many critical situations that rely heavily on exchanging confidential data. At the best of our knowledge, this research starts the study of unconditional-quantum-resistant-location-driven cryptography by using the Lattice problem for the IoT in a pre-and post-quantum world. Unlike existing schemes, the proposed cryptosystem is the first secure and unrestricted position-based protocol that guards against any number of collusion attackers and against quantum attacks. It has a guaranteed authentication process, solves the problems of distributing public keys by removing a public key infrastructure (PKI), offers secure NB-IoT without SIM cards, and resists location spoofing attacks. Furthermore, it can be generalized to any network – not just NB-IoT.},

Therefore, we propose a novel framework to assure confidential electronic design against insider threats, termed ACED-IT, that enables maintaining the confidentiality of the design when it traverses through different design stages (e.g., RTL/Gate-level to GDSII). ACED-IT integrates encryption, logic locking, novel temporary-inserted logic elements (TILEs), access controls, and action logging, to protect the design IP from insider threats originating from any entity in the process. ACED-IT is compatible with the current industry development flow and provides all engineers with the tools to complete their roles. The proposed ACED-IT framework is demonstrated across various benchmarks and analyzed for security. Benchmarks processed using ACED-IT incurred negligible overhead across parameters such as power, area, timing, and test coverage after functional recovery, and provided a brute force attack complexity to recover the original design exceeding that of AES-256.},

Most of current studies concentrate on designing anti-eavesdropping schemes. There are few studies on quantitatively evaluating the eavesdropping attacks conducted by the malicious nodes. However, it is important to investigate the eavesdropping attacks since we can design cost-effective antieavesdropping schemes if we know the eavesdropping behaviors. For example, we can offer a better protection on the confidential communications if we know which location is more vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. In this paper, we propose a general analytical framework to quantify the eavesdropping probability in wireless networks with consideration of various factors, such as node density and impacts of channel conditions. We validate the accuracy of our proposed model by conducting extensive simulations. Besides, we show that our general model can also be used to underwater acoustic networks.},

However, the success of SaaS in cloud computing cannot obscure the security challenges faced by the web applications deployed on cloud SaaS. Like other web-based systems, cloud applications are prone to most of the common web attacks. The SQL injection attack is one of the most potential threat to a SaaS application. This may result in loss of sensitive and important data (e.g., financial, personal). Through this kind of attacks, the attacker can steal critical and confidential information to a business or an organization leading to high impact on tangible (e.g., data) and intangible (e.g., reputation) assets. The purpose of this research is to investigate the potential of using machine learning techniques for SQL injection detection on the application level. The algorithms to be tested are classifiers trained on different malicious and benign payloads. They take a payload as input and decide whether the input contains a malicious code or not. The results show that these algorithms can distinguish normal payloads from malicious payloads with a detection rate higher than 98\%. The paper also compares the performance of different machine learning models in detecting SQL injection attacks.},

	abstract = {The emergence of cloud computing in integration with smart multimedia devices has created an attractive business model today. However, due to the involvement of third party servers, there is a risk of privacy for highly confidential data like surveillance images/videos. Moreover, due to inconsistent lightning conditions, there is a usual requirement of post-processing the captured multimedia for better appearance. Addressing these problems, we propose a novel cloud based privacy-preserving approach for image color enhancement in this paper. Unlike existing color correction schemes, where colors of the test image are processed in plain domain with visible image contents, we propose to perform color correction operations in the encrypted domain over cloud. As a consequence, superior results are achieved along with complete privacy assurance. In addition, we propose a block-based image encryption method using logistic-tent system and ElGamal cryptosystem. As a result, size of the encrypted image is significantly reduced as compared to the naive approach. Experimental results are performed under various tests and the proposed approach is found to be highly effective as compared to state-of-the-art schemes. Moving ahead, security strength of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a challenge response game model.},

The ciphertext is transmitted in the split-channels which are good for relay node, legitimate receiver and eavesdropper at the same time. Legitimate receiver can restore key with the assistance of relay node, and then uses the joint successive cancellation decoding algorithm to restore confidential message. Even if eavesdropper can correctly decode the ciphertext, he still cannot restore the confidential message due to the lack of key.

In the field of technology and communications, we have billions of electronic services and applications. These technological developments and the unprecedented increase technology, applications and services combined, with the expansion and proliferation of the internet, have greatly increased the frequency of data transfer over the internet. Sharing data over the internet has become a de facto standard of data transfer. This has led to an increase in the vulnerability of data being hacked during its transfer from one port to another. On the other hand, the capabilities of malicious parties in breaking the methods of protection and disclosing confidential information has also advanced and increased tremendously. Thus, organizations and individuals are looking for ways to protect their data from being hacked while it is shared with third parties. Steganography is one of the most effective ways to protect information as it uses encryption algorithms and hides information in a way that prevents attention being drawn from hackers. This research presents a new algorithm in the field of Steganography to increase the level of protection. Compared with the earlier methods, it has a double effect of the Steganography process. We call it ‘Multi-Layered Steganography Algorithm’ (MLSA). We also provide the results of the implementation and testing of the MLSA, which indicate the effectiveness of MLSA according to the protection level and resistant to revealing attacks. But, in contrast, MLSA is suitable only for small sized data sets, and does not have adequate immunity to jamming or compressing data, which we shall study in future.},

The photomosaic approach has been used for the creation of the mosaic and the least significant bit (LSB) technique has been adopted for the embedding of the hidden information. The construction of the photomosaic is done by selecting an image, splitting it into smaller images (tiles) of sizes 8×8, 16×16 and 32×32. These tiles are then compared from a very large amount of photos of the same sizes. Next, the user can either hide a secret image or a secret text into them. The final mosaic image contains secret information that is well-concealed and is impossible to find out with the naked eye. This technique is more robust compared to modifying the bits of the original image directly.},

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) was chosen as one of the encryption algorithms for testing as it is authorized by the National Security Agency (NSA). Various modes of AES, including Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and Counter with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CCM), were analyzed within the swarm architecture. The impact of these authenticated encryption algorithms on network capacity and processor performance is presented. In addition to AES, ChaCha20-Poly1305, another type of authenticated encryption scheme was studied. It was found to be the better solution for securing the swarm if classified data is not being handled or created.},

	abstract = {Blockchain has been praised for its capacity to hold data in a decentralized and tamper-proof way. It also supports the execution of code through blockchain's smart contracts, adding automation of actions to the network with high trustability. However, as smart contracts are visible by anybody on the network, the business data and logic may be at risk, thus companies could be reluctant to use such technology. This paper aims to propose a pattern that allows the execution of automatable legal contract clauses, where its execution states are stored in an on-chain smart-contract and the logic needed to enforce it wraps it off-chain. An engine completes this pattern by running a business process that corresponds to the legal contract. We then propose a pattern-based solution based on a real-life use case: transportation of refrigerated goods. We argue that this pattern guarantees companies pseudonymity and data confidentiality while ensuring that an audit trail can be reconstituted through the blockchain smart-contract to identify misbehavior or errors. This paper paves the way for a future possible implementation of the solution described, as well as its evaluation.},

Many enterprises are gaining great benefits from cloud storage services by sharing their corporate data with other users. However, the massive use of cloud computing and the lack of effective security mechanisms lead to many challenges in cloud computing. There are significant security and privacy concerns regarding data sharing as data might be stolen, eavesdropped or destroyed. In addition, data needs to be kept confidential not only from users sharing the cloud, but also from the cloud provider itself. In this paper, we propose a key management scheme for data sharing on cloud computing. Our proposed scheme allows data owners to store their files on remote servers using the cloud storage, and to share those files with other users in a secure manner. The proposed mechanism is based on bilinear pairing and provides access control by providing data owners the power to set permissions and rules over the data. Therefore, it guarantees that only authorized users can access the right data. Moreover, the proposed scheme ensures the security and privacy of data stored on cloud. Finally, informal security analysis of the proposed scheme is presented and analyzed, which demonstrates that the scheme is secure and can resist a variety of attacks.},

They manage staffs, customers, transaction, inventory, sale and labor reporting, price adjustment, as well as keeping track of cash flow, expense management, reducing human errors and more. Whether traditional on-premise POS, or Cloud-Bases POS, they help businesses to run more efficiently. However, despite all these advantages, POS systems are becoming targets of a number of cyber-attacks. Security of a POS system is a key requirement of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). This paper undertakes research into the PCI DSS and its accompanying standards, in an attempt to break or bypass security measures using varying degrees of vulnerability and penetration attacks in a methodological format. The resounding goal of this experimentation is to achieve a basis from which attacks can be made against a realistic networking environment from whence an intruder can bypass security measures thus exposing a vulnerability in the PCI DSS and potentially exposing confidential customer payment information.},

Also, it makes the task of providing security simpler while ensuring accurate results simultaneously. Integrating biometric systems with Edge Computing and Deep Learning, makes the system more robust and dynamic by reducing latency and bandwidth usage. The purpose of this paper is to present an optimal facial recognition model suitable for a wide range of applications. The system uses HOG descriptors combined with Deep Learning to identify a person from a custom database. The facial recognition system is hosted on low-power devices with the help of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) network, making it entirely edge-based. A standard Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol hosted over a local Wi-Fi network is used to facilitate communication between devices in the network. An accuracy of 98.33\% has been achieved.},

Because of the importance of privacy, many cloud storage encryption schemes have been proposed to protect data from those who do not have access. All such schemes assumed that cloud storage providers are safe and cannot be hacked; however, in practice, some authorities (i.e., coercers) may force cloud storage providers to reveal user secrets or confidential data on the cloud, thus altogether circumventing storage encryption schemes. In this paper, we present our design for a new cloud storage encryption scheme that enables cloud storage providers to create convincing fake user secrets to protect user privacy. Since coercers cannot tell if obtained secrets are true or not, the cloud storage providers ensure that user privacy is still securely protected.},

Through the cloud center, data providers can conveniently share data stored in the center with others. However, one practically important problem in big data storage is privacy. During the sharing process, data is encrypted to be confidential and anonymous. Such operation can protect privacy from being leaked out. To satisfy the practical conditions, data tranmission with multi receivers is also considered. Furthermore, this paper proposes the notion of pre-authentication for the first time, i.e., only users with certain attributes that have already been authenticated can participate in the data transmission. The pre-authentication mechanism combines the advantages of proxy conditional re-encryption multi-sharing mechanism with the attribute-based authentication technique, thus achieving attributes authentication before re-encryption, and ensuring the security of the attributes and data. Finally this paper proves that the system can resist several attacks and the proposed pre-authentication mechanism could significantly enhance the system security level.},

However, due to its security vulnerability, hackers and cybercriminals constantly attack Android mobile devices. Thus, research on effective and efficient mobile threat analysis becomes an emerging and important topic in cybersecurity research area, using various security analysis and evaluation strategies such as static analysis and dynamic analysis. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach which aggregates the static and dynamic analysis for detecting security threat and attack in mobile app. In our approach, we implement the unification of data states and software execution on the critical test path. Our approach has two phases. We first perform the static analysis to identify the possible attack critical path based on Android API and the existing attack patterns, next we perform the dynamic analysis which follows the path to execute the program in a limited and focused scope, and detect the attack possibility by checking conformance of detected path with the existing attack patterns. In the second phase of runtime dynamic analysis, dynamic inspection will report the type of attack scenarios with respect to the type of confidential data leakage, such as web browser cookie, without accessing any real critical and protected data sources in mobile devices.},

Later the undeniable signature scheme was introduced as a modern technique to verify the validity of a message sent by the sender. The undeniable signature scheme has its properties to protect the interests of the sender and receiver. An authenticated verifier only can check the signature with the approval of the signer.

At this point, we must assess what logs the forensics investigator required to find out who was behind the attack. Basically, cloud forensic is an interdisciplinary concept in between cloud computing and Digital forensics. We often do now not have get entry to the records that we are after and must approach the CSP to furnish the information we need. The problem with such type of data is that we must trust the CSP to give us the required right information. They might give us false information or hold back some very important information.

As the log files contain confidential information we require confidentiality and privacy of log infromation is an important. This work proposed Delegating log management provides cost saving measure. The project identifies a novel frame work for a challenging secure cloud based log management service by multiple encryption mechanism and effective authentication.

Using encrypted data in the cloud, a safe multiple keyword based ranked search method is described, that allows dynamic update activities such as content removal and accession. A novel Multi-Data Handling Cipher Policy (MDHCP) is introduced in this paper, in which it is used to build indexes and generate queries. The Greedy assisted Depth First Search (DFS) technique is designed based on a tree based data structure indexing and it allows for fast multiple keyword based ranked search mechanism. On top of that, it ensures correct relevance score computation between the encrypted index and query vectors by using the secured ensemble approach. Search results can be blinded by synthetic phrases inserted to the indexing vector in necessary to defend against statistical assaults. With our tree oriented indexing structure and the suggested technique is able to achieve sub linear search times and handle content deletions and insertions more easily. For the suggested plan to be proven effective, extensive testing is carried out. The resulting section shows the efficiency of the proposed approach and the graphical illustrations prove the ability of the proposed technique to maintain the data in safe manner over the cloud environment.},

In this paper, we proposed a half-decryption scheme (SDS2) for crowd owners to share privacy data with authorized users securely in a public cloud. Our scheme allows the owner to upload confidential data to a cloud, and deliver two half-decryption keys to a trusted authority and a user respectively according to our protocol. The trusted authority transfers the half-decryption key to the cloud after receiving a data sharing request. Then the user gets half-decrypted data from the cloud for further decryption. Experimental results show that computing and communication cost of our scheme is lower than other schemes with the increasing data and sharing requests.},

Nevertheless, a lot of clients are still hesitant to Due to worries about the security of sensitive and confidential data, companies are making the shift from their traditional internal IT infrastructure to a cloud storage service. The possibility of corporate data breaches and privacy losses is increased by the methods for physically locating the popularity of vulnerability assessment exploits, cloud-based virtual machine instances, and bridge assaults across virtual servers. This research offers a strategy for reducing such risks and fostering client confidence in business cloud computing. Even with well designed software systems, new flaws are found on a daily basis, and hacking methods are evolving over time. This situation makes it seem unlikely that a corporation computer processing will be completelysecure; software companies in the internet are prone to security breaches. A well-designed attack contingency plan is the practical answer to the security issues. On the plus side, if an adequate defensive mechanism is in place, cloud computing's communal infrastructure may be exploited to successfully neutralize threats. We suggest such a cloud-based threat mitigation architecture. Various software flaws in the cloud have varying degrees of severity and effects on security measures (confidentiality, integrity, and availability). We continually track and assess the risk of penetration in various security variables using the Markov model (For instance: a change in the potential to undermine the confidentiality of the data.) Our methodology would make it easier for tenants to determine their ability to deploy a dynamic mitigation approach if there is a Meanwhile to Security Flaw (MTTSF) a drastic shift in risk.

	abstract = {Confidential computing aims to secure the code and data in use by providing a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for applications using hardware features such as Intel SGX. Timing and cache side-channel attacks, however, are often outside the scope of the threat model, although once exploited they are able to break all the default security guarantees enforced by hardware. Unfortunately, tools detecting potential side-channel vulnerabilities within applications are limited and usually ignore the strong attack model and the unique programming model imposed by Intel SGX. This article proposes a precise side-channel analysis tool, ENCIDER, detecting both timing and cache side-channel vulnerabilities within SGX applications via inferring potential timing observation points and incorporating the SGX programming model into analysis. ENCIDER uses dynamic symbolic execution to decompose the side-channel requirement based on the bounded non-interference property and implements byte-level information flow tracking via API modeling. We have applied ENCIDER to 4 real-world SGX applications, 2 SGX crypto libraries, and 3 widely-used crypto libraries, and found 29 timing side channels and 73 code and data cache side channels. We also compare ENCIDER with three state-of-the-art side channel analysis tools using their benchmarks. ENCIDER does not only report most of the bugs with 20\%-50\% run time improvement and 65\%-92\% memory usage improvement, but also detects 9 missing bugs from these tools. We have reported our findings to the corresponding parties, e.g., Intel and ARM, who have confirmed most of the vulnerabilities detected.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing provides infrastructure for executing workflows that require high processing and storage capacity. Although there are several algorithms for scheduling workflows, few consider security criterion. Algorithms that cover security usually optimize either cost or makespan. However, there are cases where the user would like to choose or evaluate among different solutions that present a trade-off between monetary cost and execution time (makespan) of the workflow. The selection of the tasks, which involve confidential/sensitive data, has to prioritize the safe execution of the workflow. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective optimization for scheduling of workflow tasks in cloud environments by considering cost and makespan under different task selection policies. Extensive experiments in real-world workflows with different policies show that our approach returns several solutions in the Pareto frontier for both cost and makespan. The results revealed a reasonable ability to find Pareto frontiers during the optimization process.},

Moreover, a feedback mechanism is modeled to explain the elasticity performance of the proposed distributed system. The system extends the data locality to the edges in a trusted manner and ensures trust while scaling the whole system and increasing the number of nodes. By the help of such a trusted solution, lineage information of the data at the edges enable fault-recovery from an available checkpoint, while maximizing the trustworthiness of the overall system. Innovative distributed data structures, make databases fresh for all scaled nodes by unifying the memory resources; minimize the need to trusted third parties via trusted distributed data structures, which uses checksums of the datum periodically. Hence, multi-layer neural networks and hierarchical tree structures, has confidential data, can be updated and trained dynamically. Searching speed and performance of an object or set of objects in massive systems is maximized while keeping the trustworthiness of the total system. Initial results indicate that the trust cost worth to pay to scale and to keep the performance of the whole system. The System also shows good elasticity in the case of sudden provisioning/de-provisioning of control nodes. The proposed system also has satisfactory resource-allocation capability with efficient clustering thanks to the introduction of distributed ledger-based transaction management and lineage data recording for dynamic management of DAG structures, has sub-modular and disjoint cluster sets. Initial results of micro-blog analytics indicate promising performance of unified batch/interactive/ad-hoc querying with the holistic abstraction.},

	abstract = {Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud enables tenants to access computing infrastructure easily. An underlying physical machine that provides physical resources can host multiple virtual machines (VMs) from different tenants. These co-resident VMs share the same physical resources such as CPU cache, memory, network interface card, among which cache-based side-channel attacks (CSCAs) pose severe threats to co-resident VMs. A malicious attacker can steal confidential information of a victim through CSCAs. The accessibility and sharing of the IaaS cloud provide a natural ground for CSCAs. In this paper, we propose SCAMS, a novel system to mitigate CSCAs in the multi-tenant IaaS cloud. SCAMS consists of three phases: (i) vulnerable cryptographic operations capturing; (ii) proactive event notification; (iii) cache anomaly monitoring. In the capturing phase, we modify the cryptographic library in the protected VM to allow sensitive cryptographic functions to trap into the handler functions in the hypervisor actively. In the notification phase, the hypervisor handler functions forward sensitive cryptographic events to the unified event notifier module, and the event notifier sends monitoring instructions to the cache monitoring module. In the monitoring phase, we apply hardware performance counters to monitor the number of cache hits or cache misses of co-resident VMs to analyze their cache behaviors. We implement SCAMS in a virtualization platform. Our experimental results show that it defends against CSCAs and introduces acceptable performance overhead.},

This requires the intervention of cloud technology which enables on demand computing for Internet of Things data. The sensors which are connected to physical environment senses the values based on the source to which it is connected and those values are captured to the cloud. The cloud serves as a good health care platform for analytics, security of the sensed medical data. The collected health reports are generated on top of Software Defined Networking in which the SDN controller is incorporated at the Amazon cloud. The confidential health reports existing in the cloud should be free from network security attacks. Immediate alerts could be sent to the nurse or doctor based on the sensed information. Many diseases can be detected earlier and proper drug can be suggested to the patient in the absence of health care specialist.

We develop an approach for automated partitioning of critical Android applications into "client" code to be run in the "normal" world and "TEE commands" encapsulating the handling of confidential data to be run in the "secure" world. We also reduce the overhead due to transitions between the two worlds by choosing appropriate granularity for the TEE commands.

	abstract = {Encrypted control enables confidential controller evaluations in cloud-based or networked control systems. From a technical point of view, an encrypted controller is a modified control algorithm that is capable of computing encrypted control actions based on encrypted system states (without decrypting the states). A key technology for the design of encrypted controllers is homomorphic encryption that allows simple mathematical operations to be carried out on encrypted data. As apparent from existing schemes, one of the main challenges in encrypted control is to reformulate given control laws such that they can be merged with these special cryptosystems.In this paper, a novel encrypted implementation of model predictive control (MPC) is presented. We utilize that MPC for linear systems with polytopic constraints is well known to result in a continuous piecewise affine (PWA) control law. Thus, we can apply techniques for the decomposition of PWA functions into two convex PWA parts. The convexity of the decomposed parts finally allows us to realize a secure two-party evaluation of the original PWA function and, hence, of explicit MPC. Compared to existing encrypted MPC schemes, the novel approach makes significantly better use of computational resources offered by the two involved clouds.},

Among many other types of keyloggers, API-based keyloggers can pretend as unprivileged program running in a user-space to eavesdrop and record all the keystrokes typed by the user. In a Linux environment, defending against these types of malware means defending the kernel against being compromised and it is still an open and difficult problem. Considering how recent trend of edge computing extends cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) to the edge of the network, a new types of intrusion-detection system (IDS) has been used to mitigate cybersecurity threats in edge computing. Proposed work aims to provide secure environment by constantly checking virtual machines for the presence of keyloggers using cutting edge artificial immune system (AIS) based technology. The algorithms that exist in the field of AIS exploit the immune system's characteristics of learning and memory to solve diverse problems. We further present our approach by employing an architecture where host OS and a virtual machine (VM) layer actively collaborate to guarantee kernel integrity. This collaborative approach allows us to introspect VM by tracking events (interrupts, system calls, memory writes, network activities, etc.) and to detect anomalies by employing negative selection algorithm (NSA).},

We present ReleaseSC, a decentralized and privacy-aware system that combines smart contract with TRE. ReleaseSC leverages a novel three-part architecture that harmonizes time release and contracts, enabling efficient time-hidden smart contract. Our prototype is with reasonable performance through EVM evaluations on both private chain and official test network. ReleaseSC is built on the top of a new cryptographic notion named ID-based TRE that supports a flexible time policy and preserves the to-be-released time. We propose an ID-based TRE instantiation and show rigorous security analysis in formal security models.

The internet has revolutionised how people live and work, and cloud computing is considered as the next logical progression. Cloud security is a series of security precautions employed to safeguard cloud-based architecture, services, and information. These precautions cover client and hardware authentication, information and resource access management, and data confidentiality. People who utilize the internet should also be concerned about cloud computing security. Despite the hype, cloud computing has also created new vulnerabilities, such as unwanted access to individual's personal data and the ability to control sensitive information, which includes an underlying weak point. The encryption algorithm guarantees that the data will be kept confidential while in transit, ensuring that it can only be decoded by the authorised user. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the symmetric encryption algorithm that is more frequently utilised and more generally known nowadays. Here, the data may be accessed and exploited in a variety of ways, and it is also critical to understand the dangers. This study discusses about the different ways to guarantee that user data is secure and confidential. Finally, the future potential strategies for cloud security are examined. Moreover, the cloud computing will not only save the world, it will alter the way users engage with digital/mobile applications.},

Nevertheless, fortunately, new IT technologies are rapidly changing and challenging traditional security laws and provide new opportunities to develop the information security market. The SocialArks data breach was caused by a misconfiguration of ElasticSearch Database owned by SocialArks, owned by “Tencent.” The attack methodology is classic, and five common Elasticsearch mistakes discussed the possibilities of those leakages. The defense solution focuses on how to optimize the Elasticsearch server. Furthermore, the ElasticSearch database’s open-source identity also causes many ethical problems, which means that anyone can download and install it for free, and they can install it almost anywhere. Some companies download it and install it on their internal servers, while others download and install it in the cloud (on any provider they want). There are also cloud service companies that provide hosted versions of Elasticsearch, which means they host and manage Elasticsearch clusters for their customers, such as Company Tencent.},

More precisely, given a discrete probability distribution p(D, X, Y), where X represents the whitelisted inferences from D and Y represents the blacklisted inferences, we seek to construct a conditional distribution p(M{\textbar}D) with the dual goals of making I(M; X) large and I(M; Y) small.

In this paper we provide a faster combinatorial optimal algorithm for the perfect privacy problem, which does not require the use of an LP solver. Moreover, this algorithm any be used to compute Pareto-optimal solutions at any point on the Pareto frontier. (En route to this algorithm, we also provide a mathematical programming-based solution.)

In this scenario, the satisfaction of security and privacy requirements to preserve data integrity, confidentiality and authentication is of fundamental importance. In particular, this is essential in the healthcare sector, where health-related data are considered sensitive information able to reveal confidential details about the subject. In this regard, to limit the possibility of security attacks or privacy violations, we present a reliable mobile voice disorder detection system capable of distinguishing between healthy and pathological voices by using a machine learning algorithm. This latter is totally embedded in the mobile application, so it is able to classify the voice without the necessity of transmitting user data to or storing user data on any server. A Boosted Trees algorithm was used as the classifier, opportunely trained and validated on a dataset composed of 2003 voices. The most frequently considered acoustic parameters constituted the inputs of the classifier, estimated and analyzed in real time by the mobile application.},

Two channel models are considered, namely, a broadcast channel with confidential messages (corresponding to single-cell downlink) and an interference channel with confidential messages (corresponding to multi-cell downlink), in which multiple messages are transmitted, and it must be ensured that only the intended receiver is able to perform data decoding, thus treating non-intended receivers as potential eavesdroppers. In this multi-user scenario, the new metric global secrecy energy efficiency is introduced and optimized. Moreover, the coupling among the secrecy energy efficiencies of different users is analyzed by providing an efficient way of computing the system secrecy energy efficiency Pareto boundary. Both contributions are achieved by developing an optimization framework which suitably combines fractional programming theory and sequential optimization theory. The proposed framework is provably convergent, enjoys affordable complexity, and fulfills first-order optimality properties. Finally, the closed form conditions are provided to support smart user selection algorithms for downlink transmission.},

	abstract = {The globalization of the Integrated Circuit (IC) market is attracting an ever-growing number of partners, while remarkably lengthening the supply chain. Thereby, security concerns, such as those imposed by functional Reverse Engineering (RE), have become quintessential. RE leads to disclosure of confidential information to competitors, potentially enabling the theft of intellectual property. Traditional functional RE methods analyze a given gate-level netlist through employing pattern matching towards reconstructing the underlying basic blocks, and hence, reverse engineer the circuit’s function.In this work, we are the first to demonstrate that applying Approximate Computing (AxC) principles to circuits significantly improves the resiliency against RE. This is attributed to the increased complexity in the underlying pattern-matching process. The resiliency remains effective even for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that are presently one of the most powerful state-of-the-art techniques in functional RE. Using AxC, we demonstrate a substantial reduction in GNN average classification accuracy– from 98\% to a mere 53\%. To surmount the challenges introduced by AxC in RE, we propose the highly promising AppGNN platform, which enables GNNs (still being trained on exact circuits) to: (i) perform accurate classifications, and (ii) reverse engineer the circuit functionality, notwithstanding the applied approximation technique. AppGNN accomplishes this by implementing a novel graph-based node sampling approach that mimics generic approximation methodologies, requiring zero knowledge of the targeted approximation type.We perform an extensive evaluation targeting wide-ranging adder and multiplier circuits that are approximated using various AxC techniques, including state-of-the-art evolutionary-based approaches. We show that, using our method, we can improve the classification accuracy from 53\% to 81\% when classifying approximate adder circuits that have been generated using evolutionary algorithms, which our method is oblivious of. Our AppGNN framework is publicly available under https://github.com/ML-CAD/AppGNN},

Not only startups but also large existing giant companies are shifting their data from local server to a public cloud and sometimes even taking the initiative to build a public cloud to host their sensitive data. A cloud can provide storage services, computing services and also infrastructure without any capital or operational expenses. From a single user to a multi-national million-dollar business can easily receive several types of services from a public cloud. There are numerous cloud providers in the market. Among the prominent ones, few names are mentioned here, such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure etc. GCP offers a wide array of services for many organizations and individuals around the world like other cloud providers. But the question is, all those data, confidential information, intellectual property of individual or industries safe enough? Information has become the most expensive commodity in modern days. A government can be shutdown, a transport system can be disabled, annoying spam calls, phishing emails, cyber bullying and more security threats are existing around us. Can we trust a public service provider? Hence our initiative aims at investigating that GCP is secure from inside attackers. Why we chose inside attackers? Well the idea is to check if GCP can detect and ignore an attack launched internally. In this case it should be secure enough to prevent from outsiders as well. The research investigation would involve Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against a local virtual machine (VM) launched from GCP. There is a broad spectrum of VM's available in GCP compute engine service.},

A typed Event-B model was presented to enforce information flow security and to prevent direct flows introduced by the system. However, in practice, timing behaviours of programs can also introduce a covert flow. The problem of run-time flow monitoring and controlling must also be addressed. This paper investigates information flow control in the Event-B specification language with timing constructs. We present a timed Event-B system by introducing timers and relevant time constraints into the system events. We suggest a time-sensitive flow security condition for the timed Event-B systems, and present a type system to close the covert channels of timing flows for the system by ensuring the security condition. We then investigate how to refine timed events during the stepwise refinement modelling to satisfy the security condition.},

The DCT coefficients of the sub-images are estimated and the 8 least significant DCT coefficients are replaced by the threshold value. The threshold value depends on the confidential information to be hidden either 0 or 1. The position of the confidential information depends on the random integer generated.

Most of the service providers are changing their server storage to cloud storage. It is a great challenge for the service provider to attract the customers to store their sensitive data/file in the cloud storage. Service provisioning with respect to privacy preservation and data security is an area of concern. In general the cloud servers are being deployed on different trusted domain by different data owner. There will be need to encrypt sensitive data and store them in cloud server and disclose decryption key to authorized users. But drawback of this method is that owner of file can selectively share data by sharing his private key. Most of the computation for key distribution and management are done by the data owner. T here are various fine-grained access control models for sharing of encrypted data on cloud server. Some of these model used key policy Attribute Based Encryption (KP-ABE) and others used Cipher text Policy Attribute Based Encryption (CP-ABE). These techniques can be used to keep shared data confidential even if data is stored on remote server. These models are used to define and enforcing access control policy based on attributes and delegates most of the computation task involved in fine grained access control without disclosing data to storage server.

Text steganography changes the text format or the character of a particular text without changing the meaning of the text. Sundanese script, which already registered in the official version of the Unicode font, can be used as an alternative media to be a cover text in text steganography technique. Text steganography technique has the vulnerability to experience information loss due to attack or malfunction such as printing process with the printer and reprinting by copy machine. The line shift coding approach is used to produce good robustness level stego text and reduce the damage caused by the printing and scanning process. Line shift coding inserts binary bits of secret messages by vertically shifting the row position. The insertion of confidential information in Sundanese script steganography text replaces the Unicode character block on the shifted row. Contribution of this research is improving the secret message capacity. In ordinary line shift coding, odd row is the pivot and the secret bit is inserted on the line between those two pivots. In the improved line shift coding, we use the first and the fifth row as the pivot line to increase the message capacity. The experimental results shows the improved line shift coding has higher capacity and the stego text is able to withstand printing process and copying process up to two reprints to retain the confidential messages.},

The inherent merits of property-preserving encryption schemes make them very suitable and efficient for cloud data outsourcing. However, the security of such schemes is still a challenge because they are vulnerable to statistical attacks. We present a new order-preserving scheme for indexing encrypted data, as an alternative to propertypreserving schemes, which hides data frequency to achieve a strictly stronger notion of security. The proposed indexing method is secure against statistical attacks. Hence, data cannot be recovered from indexes. Moreover, our scheme is still efficient for query processing.},

Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown dramatic performance improvements for computing the matching cost in the stereo matching. However, the performance of CNN-based approaches relies heavily on datasets, requiring a large number of ground truth data which needs tremendous works. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework to learn CNNs for matching cost computation in an unsupervised manner. Our method leverages an image domain learning combined with stereo epipolar constraints. By exploiting the correspondence consistency between stereo images, our method selects putative positive samples in each training iteration and utilizes them to train the networks. We further propose a positive sample propagation scheme to leverage additional training samples. Our unsupervised learning method is evaluated with two kinds of network architectures, simple and precise CNNs, and shows comparable performance to that of the state-of-the-art methods including both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches on KITTI, Middlebury, HCI, and Yonsei datasets. This extensive evaluation demonstrates that the proposed learning framework can be applied to deal with various real driving conditions.},

Therefore, we propose in this paper an efficient framework for improving the security of CC-IoT based ITSs. The proposed framework allows extracting particular vehicle information without revealing any sensitive information. Towards this goal, a convolutional neural network is used to classify encrypted images, based on the vehicle type in real-time, obtained by cameras integrated into road-side units that are part of an ITS leaving sensitive information in all images hidden. Within the proposed framework, we develop a new image classification architecture that never fully decrypts the captured images, thus protecting drivers' personal information, such as location, license plate, and vehicle contents. In addition, the system does not require a fully decrypted image, which increases the system computational efficiency as compared to conventional systems. The obtained results show that the proposed partial decryption classification technique presents up to 18\% reduction in average computational complexity when compared with a fully decrypted system.},

	abstract = {Differential privacy (DP) has been widely used to protect the privacy of confidential cyber physical energy systems (CPES) data. However, applying DP without analyzing the utility, privacy, and security requirements can affect the data utility as well as help the attacker to conduct integrity attacks (e.g., False Data Injection(FDI)) leveraging the differentially private data. Existing anomaly-detection-based defense strategies against data integrity attacks in DP-based smart grids fail to minimize the attack impact while maximizing data privacy and utility. To address this challenge, it is nontrivial to apply a defensive approach during the design process. In this paper, we formulate and develop the defense strategy as a part of the design process to investigate data privacy, security, and utility in a DP-based smart grid network. We have proposed a provable relationship among the DP-parameters that enables the defender to design a fault-tolerant system against FDI attacks. To experimentally evaluate and prove the effectiveness of our proposed design approach, we have simulated the FDI attack in a DP-based grid. The evaluation indicates that the attack impact can be minimized if the designer calibrates the privacy level according to the proposed correlation of the DP-parameters to design the grid network. Moreover, we analyze the feasibility of the DP mechanism and QoS of the smart grid network in an adversarial setting. Our analysis suggests that the DP mechanism is feasible over existing privacy-preserving mechanisms in the smart grid domain. Also, the QoS of the differentially private grid applications is found satisfactory in adversarial presence.},

This movement towards interconnected industrial devices poses significant security risks as confidential data must be transferred and stored using untrustworthy channels and cloud servers. End-to-end private key cryptography is suitable to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data. However, private key cryptography has some drawbacks such as the so-called key distribution problem. A possible solution, factory installed keys, are untrustworthy as the two partners relying on end-to-end cryptography can not be sure that no other party is in possession of the used keys. To overcome these problems, the Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) principle based on Near Field Communication (NFC) and dedicated secured hardware is presented in this paper.},

For this reason, large scale storage systems and processing power are required. To address this issue, cloud storage has been recently implemented in healthcare sectors. In fact, it provides scalable computational resources as a service. Furthermore, clients are charged based on their utilization of cloud services. In spite of its multiple advantages, moving medical data to an untrusted cloud storage provider arises security concerns. Besides, health information should be kept confidential and secret. To this purpose, we propose an approach based on the Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) method and multi-cloud environment to secure cloud-based medical image storage. In this paper, we apply the proposed technique to a gray-level image. The results of implementation show that our solution enhances data security by dividing the secret image into several shares. Consequently, the proposed approach is an appropriate method that allows healthcare organizations storing and sharing patients' medical information among healthcare actors in a secure and efficient manner.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe the HeComm (Heterogeneous Communication) architecture. The HeComm architecture utilizes fog computing to provide end-to-end secured communication between IoT nodes residing in networks that operate over different communication protocols. While the fog serves as a bridge between the heterogeneous networks, it does not have access to the confidential data that are being exchanged between the IoT nodes. The HeComm architecture can be divided into two parts: the HeComm protocol and the HeComm communication. The HeComm protocol allows IoT network managers to establish a secret key that is used in the HeComm communication. The HeComm communication secures the exchanged data between the IoT nodes by using object security. This enables an end-to-end protection of the communicated data without putting all trust in the fog. We evaluate the HeComm architecture through a security analysis and via a proof-of-concept implementation that connects an IoT node in a 6LoWPAN network to a node in a LoRaWAN network. The results indicate that the IoT nodes in the HeComm architecture meet the requirements of Class 1 constrained nodes. Furthermore, the HeComm architecture comprises a combination of widely used algorithms and protocols that are often supported in modern IoT devices and platforms, which facilitates the practical deployment of our solution.},

Safeguarding confidential data from imposters is a challenging task in the smart distribution grid's communication network, with limited resources.

An average of 110 bytes is optimal for transmitting essential data from smart meter to a data concentrator / aggregator. Unique identity of Xbee node is deliberated to avoid intrusion of malicious nodes into the smart distribution grid. Data obtained from the meter is hashed using MD5 hashing algorithm to retain anonymity of the end user data. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) protocol is embraced for transport layer and the performance metrics are derived for network layer routing protocols: Ad Hoc on Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). Based on the results, it is evident that alteration of routing protocol makes notorious effect in the performance of wireless communication network. DSR protocol in network layer reduces the average time delay of packet transmission, when compared with AODV protocol applied for same network sizes.},

IIoT having interconnected machines along with devices can monitor, gather, exchange, and analyze information. Since the communication among the entities in IIoT environment takes place insecurely (for instance, wireless communications and Internet), an intruder can easily tamper with the data. Moreover, physical theft of IoT smart devices provides an intruder to mount impersonation and other attacks. To handle such critical issues, in this work, we design a new private blockchain-envisioned access control scheme for Pervasive Edge Computing (PEC) in IIoT environment, called PBACS-PECIIoT. We consider the private blockchain consisting of the transactions and registration credentials of the entities related to IIoT, because the information is strictly confidential and private. The security of PBACS-PECIIoT is significantly improved due to usage of blockchain as immutability, transparency and decentralization along with protection of various potential attacks. A meticulous comparative analysis exhibits that PBACS-PECIIoT achieves greater security and more functionality features, and requires low costs for communication and computational as compared to other pertinent schemes.},

The encoding converts the input RGB colour image into HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) format. In the formation of HSV, the order of Hue and Saturation contains phase masking of higher same order while V consists of lower order than H and S. A Fractional Fourier transform pretend as a key which offers extra degree of security in different orders. By using correct keys and Fractional orders, primary images can be recovered. The HSV image has reverted back to the RGB format again in decryption method. The level of encryption of various techniques compute the robustness of image and it is verified by mean square error (MSE) as well as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) value. Simulation results of versatile analysis shows that this algorithm provides high security and resourceful for colour image.},

Monitoring the patients at their home can extensively minimize the increasing traffic at medical centres and hospitals.

The proposed framework exploits contourlet transform coefficients to choose contour regions of the medical image which combines steganography and encryption technique to protect patient confidential data. In this system, a unified iterative process is proposed to resolve such difficulty. Moreover, we have employed a renowned Encryption algorithm in order to secure patient related data. This framework allows medical image to conceal its resultant patient confidential information and other medical data to assure the combination between medical image and the rest. Experimental results illustrates that the proposed framework proves to offer minimum retrieval error rate and as well perform better for a variety of biomedical images including CT scan, MRI and X-rays than the existing schemes. The performance parameter namely Peak signal to noise ratio, Payload, SSIM and Mean square error values are computed for the reconstructed image.

Therefore, when handling confidential data, there is a method of processing with a hybrid cloud that consists of a public cloud and a private cloud which users can use safely. In order to use the two clouds efficiently and securely in this hybrid cloud, the distributed processing framework SEMROD (Secure and Efficient MapReduce Over Hybrid Clouds) was developed. However, SEMROD has two problems: communication load and deterioration of load distribution efficiency. In this paper, we propose a method called HFK-SEMROD (Hold First Key-SEMROD) to make the existing method SEMROD more flexible and faster. Moreover, we provide two additional options of the HFK-SEMROD, whose utilizations are selectable by job types. Finally, we compare its performance with SEMROD experimentally.},

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems and the Internet of things (IoT) are becoming an integral part of the digital society. The use of IoT services improves human life in many ways. Protection against cyber threats is an utmost important prospect of IoT devices operation. Malicious activities lead to confidential data leakage and incorrect performance of devices becomes critical. Therefore, development of effective solutions that can protect both IoT devices data and data exchange networks turns in to a real challenge. This study provides a critical analysis of the feasibility of using blockchain technology to protect constrained IoT devices data, justifies the choice of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm for implementation on such devices, and simulates the main distributed ledger scenarios using PBFT. In this paper we investigate typical IoT network scenarios that can disrupt system performance. To ensure the adequacy of the models under study, we have analyzed the characteristics of real constrained IoT devices in terms of computing power and data rate. The simulation results demonstrate efficiency of the blockchain technology for constrained devices and make it possible to evaluate applicability limits of the chosen consensus algorithm.},

	abstract = {In this highly digitalized world, maintaining the security of confidential data poses to be a serious challenge. One of the security policies, that can be implemented here is encrypting the data before sending it through any communicational channel. This may attract the attention of several hackers since it is portrayed as encrypted. In this context, we have steganography as an emerging area, which hides the presence of private data within any universal transmission media so as to achieve secret communication. In this paper, we propose a new approach of encryption and insertion, which promotes an enhanced security to the confidential image. Here, 2D Discrete Haar Wavelet Transform has been applied to the cover image to compute its coefficient matrices. A scrambled form of the secret image is obtained by applying a transformation over it. To provide an imperceptible vision of the stego-image during communication via a public media, a new steganographic method known as PPMM is incorporated for secret data hiding in the wavelet coefficients. The results obtained after incorporating the algorithm shows that the same has a high imperceptibility for human vision and is thus very adept. The embedding capacity of the newly proposed technique is very high as well.},

Users do not want to share their secret information with anyone; however, the users' confidential data are not protected from the administrators. Administrators can read the users' data.

To address this issue, we propose a new secrecy protocol to store data secretly, named Secret Cloud Storage, SecretStore for short, to enable Secrecy as a Service model over the Cloud Computing paradigm. This paper demonstrates how to protect users' data from any unintended users, including the data administrators. Moreover, we introduce tight security using the client-side symmetric cryptography method. In addition, we devise a forgetful private key to generate or regenerate a private key to encrypt or decrypt based on a secret word. We also show how to strengthen the weak password. Finally, we demonstrate how to implement the Secrecy as a Service model in Cloud Storage using highly unpredictable private keys.},

Notably, it's about the storage and security of the confidential documents as well as maintaining privacy in datasets while preparing adequate retrieval and also other searching techniques have been recognized as one of the major issues in this particular area. To tackle the issues many researchers have proposed techniques and strategies which mostly deal with the conjunctive keyword search rather than a phrase search scheme. This leads to difficulty in identifying the phrases and some of the existing phrase search algorithms demand more storage cost than other conjunctive keyword techniques. We come up with a solution by introducing a novel approach in the field of encrypted searching that allows the rapid phrase exploring system to work easier. Our proposed work makes use of the incredible Bloom filter technology. To aid the functionality we have chosen n-grams. The technique emphasis on the response time by yielding the requested document to the user within no time. This scheme is adaptable to defending against inclusion-relation attack.},

Structured Query Language (SQL) Injection Attack (SQLIA) remains an intruder's exploit of choice to pilfer confidential data from the back-end database with damaging ramifications. The existing approaches were all before the new emerging computing in the context of the Internet big data mining and as such will lack the ability to cope with new signatures concealed in a large volume of web requests over time. Also, these existing approaches were strings lookup approaches aimed at on-premise application domain boundary, not applicable to roaming Cloud-hosted services' edge Software-Defined Network (SDN) to application endpoints with large web request hits. Using a Machine Learning (ML) approach provides scalable big data mining for SQLIA detection and prevention. Unfortunately, the absence of corpus to train a classifier is an issue well known in SQLIA research in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. This paper presents an application context pattern-driven corpus to train a supervised learning model. The model is trained with ML algorithms of Two-Class Support Vector Machine (TC SVM) and Two-Class Logistic Regression (TC LR) implemented on Microsoft Azure Machine Learning (MAML) studio to mitigate SQLIA.

Although, a good fairness quotient is not meeting the required standards yet due to the limited privacy and inaccessibility of the network. We propose a robust encryption method to overcome the traditional terrestrial secure data sharing problems and approach the expected demands. Enabling cryptography in healthcare edge computing systems is a preliminary prerequisite, especially after integrating IoT framework in these ecosystems. Therefore, it is paramount to allow an indispensable tool for secure data exchange among digital devices embedded through the network. Therefore, we elaborate a privacy mechanism based on fundamental mathematics to transfer text information securely throughout our research work. Introducing an innovative cryptography technique that uses a novel category of matrix called circulant matrices aims to operate confidential transmission of text messages. In addition, we modified and integrated an archaic alphanumeric method called Gematria, which derives from the Greek word “geometria”, to assign numerical values to Latin letters.},

	abstract = {Big data is referred as vast numbers of heterogeneous sources of data. The age of big data providing immense volumes of data points offers greater knowledge, such as groundbreaking research, successful management choices and greater consumer value. The details should be treated effectively in order to accomplish these objectives. The data can be in any form like structured information, unstructured information, and semi-structured records. The data can be accessed from several sources such as sensors, IOT, contact network to network, mobile to mobile communication, etc. Information security is almost as broad as big data. Information Security is pursuing essential sensitive data standards. Details relating to hospitals, client data, biometric data, financial data, confidential information, etc. can be sensitive data. Therefore, hackers can target and get confidential data quickly. If any improper access to confidential information may lead to data loss, the trust of businesses can be undermined by modification or misuse. To ensure the confidentiality of sensitive data, cryptographic methods are used. Data collection, data search and data processing should be protected by a security framework. Therefore, to deal with these systems, a new effective scheme is proposed. This study focuses on blockchain technologies to ensure critical data protection. Blockchain is a distributed database that is a collection of cryptography-generated data blocks. It contains a peer-to - peer network, distributed ledger, consensus system and infrastructure for smart contracts. The present work is proposed which involves to achieve stable data transfer \& data mining of big data, a new encryption strategy blends with block chain technology.

We develop a spatio-temporal clustering method which returns 47 public and 18 non-public meetings attended by dedicated government aircraft over the course of 18 months. Additionally, we illustrate the ease of analyzing the long-term behavior and relationships of aviation users through the example of foreign governments visiting Europe. Secondly, we exploit the same types of data to predict potential merger and acquisition (M\&A) activities by 36 corporations listed on the US and European stock markets. We identify seven M\&A cases, in all of which the buyer has used corporate aircraft to visit the target prior to the official announcement, on average 61 days before. Finally, we analyze five existing technical and non-technical mitigation options available to the individual stakeholders. We quantify their popularity and effectiveness, finding that despite their current widespread use, they are ineffective against the presented exploits. Consequently, we argue that regulatory and technical changes are required to be able to protect the privacy of non-commercial aviation users in the future.},

In order to protect confidential data, our solution involves the use of two types of chains: a private one, the sidechain, which keeps information about real ID of the patients, and a public one, the mainchain, which stores information about patients' health data marked with a temporary ID. To test it, we developed the design using Hyperledger Fabric framework. Presented experimental results show good performance of the system in relation to the following metrics: 1) the time needed to identify the medical data for a particular patient, and 2) the mainchain propagation time of all the blocks within the peer to peer network.},

Furthermore, even if a user masks all its data, it may still be inferable from the unmasked data of its friends, due to affinities in likes and personal attributes. In contrast to the conventional data mining approach, in which a model is built for all users, we build a rule set which is individualized for each user. In this paper we propose a novel rule induction approach (that incorporates predictive metrics) which enable a user to evaluate the potential risk incurred by unmasked attributes, friends' attributes and also the risk of befriending new users. We find that all of these risks are quantifiable and a risk ranking of attributes and friends/potential friends can be individualized for each user. We give examples and use cases and confirm the effectiveness of the approach, using a sophisticated synthetic OSN-data to define risk attribute and user combinations which coincide with the risk ranking produced by our algorithm.},

Safe transfer of medical data to unsafe networks these days is an important problem. With the tremendous growth of multimedia and digital technology and connected networks, today health care becomes a big step forwarded. Patient data leaks are one of the most common problems in the health care environment, which leads to misuse of patient data. With the practice of steganography method hiding the existence of hidden data within other types of media, for example, some media like text, image, audio, and video without triggering unintentional awareness. It is one of the techniques used to protect confidential or sensitive data against malicious attacks. For the diagnosis and management of a number of diseases, digital photography is required and, therefore, it is veryimportant to guarantee the careful recording of data, retrieving, and process of reviewing the medical information without violating ethics of health information practitioners. Image steganography is used to secure the transmission of health care data to conceal a confidential image (MRI or CT scan reports) on a local domain, increasing the embedded capabilities. In the field of health care, patient data such as CT scan and MRI reports are considered the most confidential data and leak reports are one of the most common problems. The proposed method also uses particle swarm performance to perform the embedding process. Therefore, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm does not require a large number of control parameters, but it can still be easily executed with a balanced computer, as it is used for collecting particles.

Together with the fast development, the CC innovation often raises questions about the privacy and security of data and applications stored in the online context. The Privacy-Preservation (PP) is perhaps the action of safeguarding an individual's private information, including confidential information, before publication. As a result, in the CC context, an innovative strategy for information along with PP is needed. Data-publication utilizing PP demands the management of distribution when leveraging a person's sensitive details. Throughout this research, we develop and implement an "Intrusion Detection System" (IDS) for data access using a hybrid strategy. Data-Gathering and Data-Publishing are two stages of system implementation. The data is being collected from the owner first by cloud server in the initial phase, however, during the latter phase, the server transmits the gathered data to the general or data-miners, referred to as data-consumers. Thus this work aims to build up a method for PP in the CC environment utilizing the Pigeon-Optimization (PO) method for locating the secure storage space by feature selection and Tiger-Hash-key (THK) generation method for converting the original data into PP data, thus by combining Pigeon with Tiger (PO-THK) hybrid method was proposed to improve the security in a cloud environment.

	abstract = {Cloud computing is one of the highly flexible, confidential and easily accessible medium of platforms and provides powerful service for sharing information over the Internet. Cloud security has become an emerging issue as network manager eventually encounter its data protection, vulnerability during information exchange on the cloud system. We can protect our data from unwanted access on a hybrid cloud through controlling the respective firewall of the network. But, the firewall has already proved its weakness as it is unable to ensure multi-layered, secured accessibility of the cloud network. Efficient packet utilization sometimes causes high response time in accessing hybrid cloud. In this paper, a Cloud Model with Hybrid functionality and a secure Fuzzy Integrated Firewall for that Hybrid Cloud is proposed and thereby evaluated for the performance in traffic response. Experimental result illustrated that having a fuzzified firewall gives high point-to-point packet utilization decreasing the response time than a conventional firewall. Results from this research work will highly be implemented in transplanting artificial intelligence in future Internet of Things (IoT).},

	abstract = {Lawful Interception (LI) is a legal obligation of Communication Service Providers (CSPs) to provide interception capabilities to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) in order to gain insightful data from network communications for criminal proceedings, e.g., network identifiers for tracking suspects. With the privacy-enhancements of network identifiers in the 5th generation of mobile networks (5G), LEAs need to interact with CSPs for network identifier resolution. This raises new privacy issues, as untrusted CSPs are able to infer sensitive information about ongoing investigations, e.g., the identities of their subscribers under suspicion. In this work, we propose P3LI5, a novel system that enables LEAs to privately query CSPs for network identifier resolution leveraging on an information retrieval protocol, SparseWPIR, that is based on private information retrieval and its weakly private version. As such, P3LI5 can be adapted to various operational scenarios with different confidentiality or latency requirements, by selectively allowing a bounded information leakage for improved performance. We implement P3LI5 on the 5G LI infrastructure using well known open-source projects and demonstrate its scalability to large databases while retaining low latency. To the best of our knowledge, P3LI5 is the first proposal for addressing the privacy issues raised by the mandatory requirement for LI on the 5G core network.},

	abstract = {The Internet of things (IoT) has many unexplored potentials. Features such as low purchasing costs, low energy consumption, and small size make the Internet of things indispensable and irreplaceable. However, the fact that they only have enough processor power to run particular tasks has led to the failure of implementation of many traditional security measures to the IoT environment, which are developed to date. Furthermore, the producers bring early products to the market due to the market share concerns. Moreover, the lack of knowledge of security measures to be taken by developers creates lots of security loopholes and causes unauthorized persons to seize a lot of valuable information, which undermines the trust of the users. Likewise, the unpredictable and rapid growth of IoT devices highlights the importance of scalability, authorization and encryption issues. Although partial solutions are being suggested to address these concerns, a generally accepted solution still does not exist. Thanks to its tamper-proof, decentralized, distributed, programmable structure, blockchain can be used as a solution to these security concerns. Blockchain-based authentication and access control systems can be used to strengthen IoT security. Until recently, it has been thought that communication over the blockchain network is not possible for resource-constrained devices because the communication depends on using not only complex but also memory hungry cryptography algorithms. In this paper, our application aims resource-constrained device authorization through the blockchain network that is presented together with the analysis and test results related to this study.},

	abstract = {Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANet) are an assortment of wireless mobile nodes leading to flexible mobile networks, consequently eliminating constraint of any infrastructure and central access points. Due to enhanced utilization of a MANet, security has turned into a fundamental necessity because of its dynamic topology, inadequate processing capability, bandwidth confinements and high bit error rate etc. To present secure communication between wireless nodes, there is a requirement to construct multi-fence security and routing solutions to cope up with these challenges. In this paper, a mechanism named `novel secure authentication mechanism for communication in mobile ad-hoc networks' is proposed which is derived from our previously published work [1]. The mechanism comprises two phases namely: authentication and confidential communication. In authentication phase, prior to joining the ad-hoc network, nodes are authenticated via acquiring security credentials from a server. In confidential communication phase, communication between two nodes is secured via making utilization of symmetric key cryptography for data encryption. Moreover, the stipulation of dual security in our scheme enables communication networks to be more secure against established security threats and vulnerabilities. Results demonstrate that validation of nodes before joining the ad-hoc network does not take excessive time. The results show that the proposed schemes is faster for new and existing nodes to join the network.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579834},
	abstract = {Medical data transmission and sharing, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic period, on the open channel have become more important for remote diagnosis and treatment purpose. However, the alteration and unauthorized distribution of image data has become easier, and thus the big issue of copy-protection and ownership conflicts has attracted more attention for healthcare research community. Further, large amount of confidential and personal medical records is often stored on cloud environments. However, outsourcing medical data possibly brings the great security and privacy issue, since the confidential records are shared to the third party. In this paper, a robust X-Ray image watermarking is proposed by using Non-Subsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT) and Multiresolution Singular Value Decomposition (MSVD). For watermark embedding, the maximum entropy component of X-Ray carrier image is firstly decomposed using NSCT. Then, low and high frequency details of carrier and mark image is obtained using MSVD. Further, conceal the watermark detail through modifying the detail of carrier image via the suitable factor. Finally, Shamir's (k, n) secret sharing algorithm is employed to obtain secure marked carrier image. Objective evaluations on 200 X-Ray images of COVID-19 patients demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has not only an excellent invisibility but a strong robustness against the various attacks. The results also show that our algorithm outperforms the related image watermarking algorithms, since it is also suitable for applications in the multi-cloud.},

	doi = {10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00141},
	abstract = {Intents are Android's intra and inter-application communication mechanism. They specify an action to perform, with extra data, and are sent to a receiver component or broadcast to many components. Components, in the same or in a distinct app, receive the intent if they are available to perform the desired action. Hence, a sound static analyzer must be aware of information flows through intents. That can be achieved by considering intents as both source (when reading) and sink (when writing) of confidential data. But this is overly conservative if the intent stays inside the same app or if the set of apps installed on the device is known in advance. In such cases, a sound approximation of the flow of intents leads to a more precise analysis. This work describes SDLI, a novel static analyzer that, for each app, creates an XML summary file reporting a description of the tainted information in outwards intents and of the intents the app is available to serve. SDLI discovers confidential information leaks when two apps communicate, by matching their XML summaries, looking for tainted outwards intents of the first app that can be inwards intents of the second app. The tool is implemented inside Julia, an industrial static analyzer. On the DroidBench testcases, its shows a precision higher than 75\%. On some popular apps from the Google Play marketplace, it spots inter-apps leaks of confidential data, hence showing its practical effectiveness.},

Multi secret image sharing system (MSIS) is an efficient and robust method for transmitting one or more secret images securely. In recent research, n secret images are encrypted into n or n+ 1 shared image's and stored in different database servers. Decoder has to receive all n or n+1 encrypted images to reproduce the secret image. One can recover partial secret information from n-1 or fewer shared images, which poses risk for the confidential information encrypted. In this proposed paper we developed a novel algorithm to increase the sharing capacity by using (n, n/8) multi secret sharing scheme with increased security by generating unique security key. An unrevealed comparison image is used to produce shares which makes the secret image invulnerable to the hackers.},

	abstract = {Smart Card is something that is used for data transactions quickly and practically. The definition of ”smart” is when a card has a chip implanted. The card is very helpful in the authentication and administration process even during emergencies, such as a patient healthcare record at the hospital. In this case study, patient data should only be accessed and known by people who have rights. So it is necessary for the security of data storage such as cryptography algorithms. The algorithm needed for patient cards is an algorithm that has fast processing capability and a high level of security. So the aim of this study is to implement the Tiny Encryption Algorithm on Smart Cards. Based on the results of testing in this study the time of encrypting patient data with a total of 600 lines of patient history measuring 30.6 Kb produces an average encryption time of 20.17 ms. While the decryption for the same data takes 17.21 ms which shows very little processing time and the tolerance for waiting time for accessing data. Furthermore, the Avalanche Effect test carried out in the TEA encryption process results 77\%, where these results indicate that encrypted data has very random cipher-text results so that the data contents are kept confidential with a high level of security. The results of testing the processing time and AE can be concluded that TEA is an algorithm that has a fast data security process with high security and time that can be tolerated by users.},

These days, securing medical images from eavesdroppers is one of the most challenging and significant research areas. Due to various attacks from eavesdroppers, medical images need to be store and send in the encrypted format. In order to secure medical image data from unauthorised access, a DNA (Deoxyri-bonucleic acid) sequence based medical image encryption scheme is proposed. First of all, for a given value of DNA sequence, a hash value via SHA-512 is computed. This hash value is given as a secret key to the Intertwining Logistic map. Through chaotic sequences, the correlation among pixels is reduced using shuffling process. The shuffled image is XORed with the chaotic random values for the diffusion. Finally, the affine transformation is applied to the diffused image. Extensive and detailed security analyses reveal the importance and advantages of the proposed scheme when compared to other conventional image encryption schemes.},

	abstract = {In the cloud, for achieving access control and keeping data confidential, the data owners could adopt attribute-based encryption to encrypt the stored data. Users with limited computing power are however more likely to delegate the mask of the decryption task to the cloud servers to reduce the computing cost. As a result, attribute-based encryption with delegation emerges. Still, there are caveats and questions remaining in the previous relevant works. For instance, during the delegation, the cloud servers could tamper or replace the delegated ciphertext and respond a forged computing result with malicious intent. They may also cheat the eligible users by responding them that they are ineligible for the purpose of cost saving. Furthermore, during the encryption, the access policies may not be flexible enough as well. Since policy for general circuits enables to achieve the strongest form of access control, a construction for realizing circuit ciphertext-policy attribute-based hybrid encryption with verifiable delegation has been considered in our work. In such a system, combined with verifiable computation and encrypt-then-mac mechanism, the data confidentiality, the fine-grained access control and the correctness of the delegated computing results are well guaranteed at the same time. Besides, our scheme achieves security against chosen-plaintext attacks under the k-multilinear Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption. Moreover, an extensive simulation campaign confirms the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed solution.},

Currently practiced techniques of de-identification of personal and confidential information either insufficiently consider or plainly ignore data dependencies, and, therefore, carry serious risks of re-identification of confidential data. This paper describes four privacy attack models which correlate data identifiers from the existing internal data set with those data identifiers which are available from external sources. The attacks described herein allow a hacker to perform de-clustering of a public data set by either disclosing values of identifiers, or by adding new values into the original dataset which will increase the probability of re-identification. These attribute disclosure attacks carry direct risks to generally accepted privacy models, such as 1-diversity, k-anonymity, and t-closeness. We develop probabilistic risk metrics for re-identification and sensitive data disclosure, and use them to calculate the risks associated with each of the attribute disclosure attacks. The attribute disclosure attacks demonstrably increase the overall re-identification and disclosure risk by an average of up to 3.3 times the original risk.},

In this article, we revisit the design of ring confidential transaction protocol and put forward a more efficient privacy-preserving payment protocol, which is built upon an extended version of one-out-of-many proof and a special multi-signature. Compared with previous works, the new protocol is not only more practical, but also does not suffer from a trusted setup. Besides, we show that the protocol satisfies the security requirements provided that the underlying cryptographic primitives are secure in the random oracle model.

The secure configuration server can co-work with the SINETStream-based IoT systems.

	abstract = {The back-end database is pivotal to the storage of the massive size of big data Internet exchanges stemming from cloud-hosted web applications to Internet of Things (IoT) smart devices. Structured Query Language (SQL) Injection Attack (SQLIA) remains an intruder's exploit of choice on vulnerable web applications to pilfer confidential data from the database with potentially damaging consequences. The existing solutions of mostly signature approaches were all before the recent challenges of big data mining and at such lacks the functionality and ability to cope with new signatures concealed in web requests. An alternative Machine Learning (ML) predictive analytics provides a functional and scalable mining to big data in detection and prevention of SQLIA. Unfortunately, lack of availability of readymade robust corpus or data set with patterns and historical data items to train a classifier are issues well known in SQLIA research. In this paper, we explore the generation of data set containing extraction from known attack patterns including SQL tokens and symbols present at injection points. Also, as a test case, we build a web application that expects dictionary word list as vector variables to demonstrate massive quantities of learning data. The data set is pre-processed, labelled and feature hashing for supervised learning. The trained classifier to be deployed as a web service that is consumed in a custom dot NET application implementing a web proxy Application Programming Interface (API) to intercept and accurately predict SQLIA in web requests thereby preventing malicious web requests from reaching the protected back-end database. This paper demonstrates a full proof of concept implementation of an ML predictive analytics and deployment of resultant web service that accurately predicts and prevents SQLIA with empirical evaluations presented in Confusion Matrix (CM) and Receiver Operating Curve (ROC).},

	abstract = {The promise of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with the mobile edge computing (MEC), named MEC-aided-UAV extends the MEC application to offer new flexible, low-latency computing services and considerable utilities for pervasive sensing of the world. In MEC, the UAV with limited on-board energy and computation resources needs to offload its tasks to resource-rich ground base stations (GBSs) servers. Because of the broadcast nature of line-of-sight (LoS) channels, one of the key challenges in task offloading is to guarantee that confidential data is offloaded safely to the GBSs without being intercepted by eavesdroppers (Eves). In this MEC-aided-UAV system, the GBSs help the UAV compute the offloaded tasks and transmit the artificial noise (AN) to suppress the vicious Eves. We make the first attempt to study the maximum-minimum average secrecy capacity problem, including joint optimization of the trajectory and transmit power of the UAV, the transmit power of AN, the local computation ratio, and the selection of GBSs with consideration of the practical constraints of completion delay of the tasks, maximum velocity, and the power consumption. The optimization issue is confirmed as a mixed-integer non-convex problem. Thereafter, a low-complexity iterative algorithm with the block coordinate descent method and successive convex approximation technique is put forward to get its suboptimal solution. In addition, the convergent solution can be achieved by solving the subproblems in turn. Evaluation results validate that the proposed secure offloading scheme significantly effectiveness the baselines by 17.4\%-71.2\% on the maximum-minimum average secrecy capacity.},

	abstract = {Application Layer Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are very challenging to detect and mitigate. The various possible application layer attacks are HTTP flooding, XML attack, DNS attacks, etc. The most common and renowned application layer attack is HTTP flooding. The HTTP flooding detection and mitigation is an interesting research topic in computer networks. There are various research solutions proposed by validating against HTTP flooding; using tools such as Golden Eye, LOIC, proprietary tools, etc. HTTP flooding attacks generated using any existing tools may not exhibit similar characteristics of the real time HTTP flooding attack. The real time HTTP flooding attack data sets available in the internet, for example FIFA World Cup 1998 data set. The data sets are stored in processed log format due to security and confidential reasons. So, it cannot be directly used to regenerate real time attacks to test research solution. Also, there is no proper way or mechanism to regenerate attacks from data set log files. The proposed work gives a solution for regenerating HTTP flooding attack using WORLD CUP 1998 data set log files. The paper further augments detailed discussion, steps involved in conversion of the log files into HTTP requests, logging captures, performance analysis of the work and future enhancements.},

Mainly two issues are examined: 1) Comparing the confidential ability by using different multiple antenna technologies. 2) Improving the confidential ability by using multi-input multi-output systems (MIMO). The evaluation of secrecy capacity for a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) signal under different antenna technologies is presented. The results show that the confidentiality rate can be improved at the cost of deploying more antennas either at transmitter or at receiver or at both.

The data being outsourced by the client in a storage server may get corrupted. This leads to a threat to the integrity of the client's confidential data. We use a technique called Provable Data Possession (PDP) [1] using which we verify the integrity of the outsourced data in an untrusted server without retrieving the entire file from the cloud server or having a copy of the data. Identity Based Encryption (IBE) [5] and other PDP schemes are used for its implementation. To implement PDP (provable Data Possession) in verifying the integrity of the outsourced data we use HMAC (Hashed Message Authentication Code). A message digest is generated using HMAC with the combination of a secret key. A secret key is generated for the user identity by running a setup algorithm which performs Identity Based Encryption (IBE). One of the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) will act as a combiner. The proof generated by the Cloud service provider is verified by the client which will be acting as a verifier. The Cloud Service Provider is reported if the proof generated by the prover is wrong.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, there is an upsurge in reliance on web usage. Many of these web applications make use of password-based authentication. Ensuring a secure password protection mechanism is crucial for maintaining the overall confidentiality of computer systems. Despite extensive research on creating strong, reliable, confidential passwords, several challenges still exist. One such issue is weaker password-based encryption (PBE). This paper proposes Honey2Fish, a hybrid encryption approach that uses Honey encryption (HE) and Twofish for enhanced password and message security. A two-layer protection mechanism protects both the privacy of credentials and the messages. This approach provides improved performance and enhanced security while keeping the system’s overall complexity low for securing passwords and messages. The proposed solution uses honeywords to give bogus but justified data while encrypting with an incorrect password to safeguard against brute force attacks. This paper further examines contemporary honeyword creation algorithms and proposes a user-centric approach to avoid human error while entering passwords. The validation of the research suggests that Honey2Fish is useful and secure in real-life password-based authentications. The result shows Honey2Fish has an average of 50\% avalanche property with good throughput.},

	abstract = {As a result of the information explosion and the development of the technology of the Internet of Things (IoT), tons of data are collected and transmitted, some of which may concern private or confidential information. Sensors, as the building blocks of such processes, are commonly resource-limited. For instance, they rarely possess large storage space, abundant electricity reserves, or sufficient computing power. So, how to improve the efficiency of data acquisition and transmission without trimming security has attracted much attention from researchers. Recently, compressive sensing (CS) theory has been exploited to improve the efficiency of data collection and transmission, while there are some drawbacks to existing CS-based data collection and transmission schemes. For instance, many existing CS-based data transmission methods lack data encryption or privacy protection mechanisms, meaning that private or confidential information may be exposed to uncertainty if such data are captured during transmission. This article proposes a method of collecting and transmitting data securely and efficiently based on P -tensor product (PTP) CS and secret key encryption mechanism. It could provide data security under the assumption that participants and data processing domains are trusted. And adversaries could not obtain useful information, even if they manage to capture data that are transmitted. Compared with most existing compressive-sensing-based methods, the proposed method addresses privacy protection issues by realizing multilevel critical information concealment. By reducing the scale of measurement matrices, it achieves lower computing and storage resource consumption. To transmit data more securely, it also provides an encryption mechanism with sufficient key space and high key sensitivity. Overall, the proposed method is secure, energy-efficient, and provides privacy protection functions, which makes it particularly suitable for IoT sensor nodes with restricted computing power and storage capacity.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of telecommunications and cellular network technologies gave birth to a range of services and scenarios that were considered impossible a decade ago. Various architectures, scenarios, and use-cases can be deployed on top of the different generations of cellular networks to solve different business cases. Some scenarios require a high level of reliability due to their critical usage e.g., Vehicular Edge computing, medical IoT and so on. When offering services at the edge of the network, the information exchanged needs to be current and valid for systematic performance assessment and modeling. However, in order to run experiments, access to valid and reliable telecommunication data e.g., eNodeB (Base Station) properties, and configurations is not easy, since in most cases data is either confidential or at least difficult to obtain, especially when dealing with cross organizational boundaries (e.g., data coming from multiple telecom operators). To bridge this gap and allow researchers to build, test and analyze new protocols and algorithms with telecommunication data, we designed a mobile data generator (DG) for multi-domain cellular networks. Our generator provides a range of possible configurations and handles scenarios that include multiple participants, authorities and organizations. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of our generator. We evaluated the data generator by considering different scenarios, specifically, we have tested service interruptions and mobile network migration since these scenarios require a considerable amount of data.},

In this paper, we propose the Domain and Range Specific Index Generation(DRSIG) scheme that minimizes the Index Generation time. This scheme adopts collection sort technique to split the index file into D Domains and R Ranges. The Domain is based on the length of the keyword; the Range splits within the domain based on the first letter of the keyword. A mathematical model is used to encrypt the indexed keyword that eliminates the information leakage. The time complexity of the index generation is O(NT × 3) where NT - Number of rows in index document and 3 is Number of columns in index document. Experiments have been conducted on real world dataset to validate proposed DRSIG scheme. It is observed that DRSIG scheme is efficient and provide more secure data than Ranked Searchable Symmetric Encryption(RSSE) Scheme.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology is heralded for its ability to provide transparent and immutable audit trails for data shared among semi-trusted parties. With the addition of smart contracts, blockchains can track and verify arbitrary computations – which enables blockchain users to verify the provenance of information derived from data through the blockchain. This provenance comes at the cost of data confidentiality and user privacy, however, which is unacceptable for many sensitive applications. The need for verifiable yet confidential data sharing and computation has led some to add trusted execution environment (TEE) hardware to blockchain platforms. By moving sensitive operations (e.g., data decryption and analysis) off of the blockchain and into a TEE, they get both the confidentiality of TEEs and the transparency of blockchains without the need to completely trust any one party in the data-sharing ecosystem.In this paper, we build on our TEE-enabled blockchain data-sharing system, Amanuensis, to ensure the freshness of access-control lists shared between the blockchain and TEE, and to improve the privacy of users interacting within the system. We also detail how TEE-based remote attestation help us to achieve information provenance – specifically, how to achieve information provenance in the context of the Intel SGX trusted execution environment. Finally, we present an evaluation of our system, in which we test several real-world machine-learning applications (logistic regression, kNN, SVM) to determine the run-time overhead of information confidentiality and provenance. Each machine-learning program exhibited a slowdown between 1.1 and 2.8x when run inside of our confidential environment, and took an average of 59 milliseconds to verify the provenance of an input data set.},

Notwithstanding the benefits of AI tools, healthcare industry data has become a central target for many cyber invaders in this era of big data, as they are regarded as valuable information. Health care data breaches occur due to unauthorized access to patients’ health records that violate the privacy and security of confidential health information. Therefore, this study aimed to use Microsoft Power BI tools to conduct in-depth data analytics and visualization on healthcare data breaches to determine the causes of the breach and provide insights that will help to enhance healthcare data security and confidentiality. This study observed from the analysis that Hacking /IT incidents are the major predominant types of data breaches in the healthcare industry, followed by unauthorized access/disclosures. This study was able to identify the significant factors that contribute to healthcare data breaches. The insight produced from this study could potentially contribute to our understanding of data breaches and set the benchmark that future security experts will undoubtedly tackle.

	abstract = {In communicating in public networks, data security becomes very important. There are many risks of data theft by other parties. Cryptography is one technique for securing data. In cryptography, there are two main processes, namely encryption, and decryption. Encryption is the process of encoding the original or plaintext file into an encrypted or ciphertext file. While decryption is the process of returning encrypted data or ciphertext into original or plaintext data. There are various encryption algorithms nowadays, where the more complex encryption logically encryption will be stronger and harder to solve. This study proposed a combination of the AES and RC4 algorithms to provide protection against confidential data. The combination of this method aims to make the algorithm more complex and strong. To find out how safe an algorithm is, test the avalanche effect (AE). AE measurement is done by changing the value of one bit in the key, then the two results are ciphertext compared to the difference. The greater the difference, the better the encryption results. The ideal AE is around 50\% and the greater the AE value means the better the quality of data encryption. Based on the combination test of the AES-RC4 method, the best AE results are 58.2\%, where this value is far better than the AES algorithm, RC4 only or RC4-AES.},

Our objective is to optimize the information bearing beam and artificial energy-carrying noise beam in order to maximize the secrecy rate of the IRs subject to individual harvested energy constraints of the ERs for the case where the ERs can form eavesdropping party to carry out joint decoding in an attempt to illicitly decode the secret message intended for the IRs. The initial non-convex problem is converted to convex problem through semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation for both perfect CSI and imperfect CSI. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance.},

	abstract = {Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is the cornerstone of confidential computing. Among other TEEs, Intel® Secure Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) is the most prominent solution that is frequently used in the public cloud to provide confidential computing services. Intel® SGX promotes runtime confidentiality and integrity of enclaves with minimal modifications to existing CPU microarchitectures. However, Transient Execution Attacks, such as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF), Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS), and Transactional Asynchronous Abort (TAA) have exposed certain vulnerabilities within Intel® SGX solution. Over the past few years, Intel has developed various countermeasures against most of these vulnerabilities via microcode updates and hardware fixes. However, arguably, there are no existing tools nor studies that can measurably verify the effectiveness of these countermeasures. In this paper, we introduce an automated analysis tool, called ENCLYZER, to evaluate Transient Execution Vulnerabilities on Intel® SGX. We leverage ENCLYZER to comprehensively analyze a set of processors, with multiple versions of their microcode, to verify the correctness of these countermeasures. Our empirical analysis suggests that most countermeasures are effective in preventing attacks that are initiated from the same CPU hyperthread, but less effective for cross-thread attacks. Therefore, the application of the latest microcode patches and disabling hyperthreading is warranted to enhance the security of Intel® SGX-enabled systems. Security Configurations like hyperthreading disabled/enabled are attestable on Intel® SGX platform to provide user with increased confidence in making decision on system trustworthiness. Note that the Security Configurations cannot be modified without a system reboot.},

As the method for concealing the true state is relatively simple, it enables us to achieve rapid real-time communication between a controlled device and the Fog. The level of confidentiality was measured using the mutual information between the true and concealed states. As a solution to our problem, we obtained Gaussian-type security inputs and a convex optimization problem for calculating feedback gains. Moreover, we proved that the main solution becomes all solutions for any scalar cases. Finally, we demonstrated the feasibility of our proposed method by solving the problem of tracking the reference signal of storage batteries in smart grids.},

This is superior to existing coverless schemes which require transmitting a stream of stego images in sequence due to the issue of small hiding capacity per stego image. In addition, by directly linking the secret with existing or generated images, coverless schemes are proven to be more secure as compared to traditional image steganography which embeds confidential message by modifying pixel values of a given image (known as cover). Specifically, we build a dictionary- based encoding scheme using images of the MNIST handwritten digit dataset to generate the stego image. In this dataset, thousands of images carry the same digit but have variance in their shapes and pixel depth. Thus it serves as a good codebook to represent information. The proposed coverless steganography scheme holds necessary resistance to image processing operations like JPEG compression, image binarization, image scaling and image noise, i.e., the hidden message can be successfully decoded from the processed stego images.},

Therefore, multiple data owners are motivated to share their own data for training a brilliant model with the aggregated dataset. Notwithstanding, it is unrealistic to share data due to the potential conflict of interest. For addressing the issue of data island, a new federated framework namely FedCAE is proposed for fault diagnosis. In this framework, each client is equipped with a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) trained by its corresponding local data. Then, all CAEs are uploaded to a server and aggregated to a global CAE according to an adaptive weighted selection mechanism. Afterwards, the global CAE is downloaded to all clients for extracting low-level features from local datasets by its encoder and uploading these features to train a global fault diagnosis classifier in the server. At last, the classifier is downloaded to all clients for completing their own diagnosis tasks. Experiment results on two bearing datasets suggest FedCAE offers a promising solution on confidential decentralized learning.},

To overcome the privacy issue an ORUTA (One Ring to Rule Them All) scheme is used to preserve the privacy of users and help the auditing process on distributed data that is accumulate in the cloud. ORUTA scheme includes ring signature that is essential to hide the users identity on distributed resources. Using ORUTA scheme, the identity of user on every file is kept under confidential or hidden from external auditors. External auditors are capable to examine the distributed data accuracy without getting the whole file.

After all, public auditing on the integrity of shared data with pervious extant mechanisms will somehow affirm the confidential information and its identity privacy to the public verifiers. In this paper, to achieve the privacy preserving public for auditing, we intended an explanation for TPA using three way handshaking protocol through the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) with liberated encryption standard. Appropriately, from the cloud, we use the VerifyProof execute by TPA to audit to certify. In addition to this mechanism, the identity of each segment in the shared data is kept private from the public verifiers.

Most of the organization are changing their storage server to cloud server without any botheration. It is a great challenge for the cloud service provider to attract the customers to store their sensitive data/file in the cloud storage. Service provisioning with respect to privacy preservation and data security is an area of concern. In general the cloud servers are being deployed on different trusted domain. Fine grained access control is major area of concern in data outsourcing and sharing in untrusted cloud server. There will be need to encrypt sensitive data and store them in cloud server and disclose decryption key to authorized users. But drawback of this method is that owner of file has to know receivers prior to encryption which is not possible in most of the case. Cipher text Policy Attribute Based Encryption (CPABE) is one of the technique that is used for fine grained access control in untrusted server. This techniques used to keep shared data confidential even if data is stored on remote server. It uses trusted authority to issue attribute and distribute key to users in the system. There can be multiple authority in a CPABE system and each authority issue attributes and keys independent of each other. Efficient decryption and attribute revocation is major area of research in multi authority cloud storage system.

	abstract = {In recent years, as the number of cloud services increases, leakage of confidential information is a matter of concern. Techniques for processing data while preserving confidentiality of data are called secure computation, and secure computation based on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE for short) is one of the most important ways of realizing secure computation. FHE is a cryptosystem that can perform both arbitrary times of additions and multiplications of data in the encrypted state. Therefore, by using FHE, we can realize arbitrary operations in the encrypted state. However, it is not so easy to realize complex operations using FHE in practice. In particular, there are difficulties in realizing complex operations with high accuracy. Such computation is highly desired in various situations (e.g., in computing medical statistics). Nevertheless, the methodology to compute complex operations given a certain accuracy is not well studied so far. In this research, we propose a method to compute division and a u-th root in the encrypted state using FHE. In the proposed method, the result of an operation can achieve the given accuracy. We employ the n-th order maclaurin approximate polynomial to approximate division and a u-th root by homomorphic addition and multiplication. We evaluate the error of an approximation using a remainder term. Also, we implemented the proposed method and measured execution time for division and a square root.},

In this paper, we present the vulnerabilities of SaaS architecture for security attacks and address the authentication attack among them. In our study, we analyze that every attack is possible only when the attacker overcomes the obligations of authentication and once he gains the access then everything is in his hands. So, in this paper we discuss about authentication attack with detailed information. Also, we find weakness of SaaS architecture. To overcome this weakness, we proposed novel process for signature verification architecture to improve the SaaS signature verification process by closing the vulnerability for authentication attacks.

Due to the low trustiness of the server, it is crucial to guarantee both the security and efficiency in delegation. Motivated by those challenges, a rapidly-growing body of research mostly focuses on how to delegate mostly utilizing a feasible mechanism-verifiable computation, where the server returns results along with corresponding verification proofs. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacyprotected delegation scheme for matrix multiplication (EPPDMM) of amortized model.

	abstract = {Large volumes of data required to train accurate deep neural networks (DNNs) are seldom available with any single entity. Often, privacy concerns prevent entities from sharing data with each other or with a third-party learning service provider. While crosssilo federated learning (FL) allows collaborative learning of large DNNs without sharing the data itself, most existing cross-silo FL algorithms have an unacceptable utility-privacy trade-off. In this work, we propose a framework called Confidential and Private Decentralized (CaPriDe) learning, which optimally leverages the power of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to enable collaborative learning without compromising on the confidentiality and privacy of data. In CaPridDe learning, participating entities release their private data in an encrypted form allowing other participants to perform inference in the encrypted domain. The crux of CaPriDe learning is mutual knowledge distillation between multiple local models through a novel distillation loss, which is an approximation of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the local predictions and encrypted inferences of other participants on the same data that can be computed in the encrypted domain. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that CaPriDe learning can improve the accuracy of local models without any central coordination, provide strong guarantees of data confidentiality and privacy, and has the ability to handle statistical heterogeneity. Constraints on the model architecture (arising from the need to be FHE-friendly), limited scalability, and computational complexity of encrypted domain inference are the main limitations of the proposed approach.

Additionally, the demand for privacy preservation where sensitive information such as the trade amounts and balances is not disclosed is increasing. However, privacy preservation in a typical blockchain setting is difficult because it prevents parties that are not involved in the transaction from checking the correctness of the transaction being processed, which may lead to unintended or invalid transactions. To address this issue, herein we propose a protocol that allows the consistency with regard to the transaction amount and the balance to be checked without disclosing their values. Specifically, we exploit a homomorphic encryption to encrypt the transaction amount and balance. Thus, the correctness of a transaction can be publicly verified by the parties using the zero-knowledge proof without a trusted third party.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a kind of connected infrastructure of smart medical devices along with software applications, health systems and services. These medical devices and applications are connected to healthcare systems through the Internet. The Wi-Fi enabled devices facilitate machine-to-machine communication and link to the cloud platforms for data storage. IoMT has the ability to make accurate diagnoses, with fewer mistakes and lower costs of care. IoMT with smartphone applications permits the patients to exchange their health related confidential and private information to the healthcare experts (i.e., doctors) for the better control of diseases, and also for tracking and preventing chronic illnesses. Due to insecure communication among the entities involved in IoMT, an attacker can tamper with the confidential and private health related information for example an attacker can not only intercept the messages, but can also modify, delete or insert malicious messages during communication. To deal this sensitive issue, we design a novel blockchain enabled authentication key agreement protocol for IoMT environment, called BAKMP-IoMT. BAKMP-IoMT provides secure key management between implantable medical devices and personal servers and between personal servers and cloud servers. The legitimate users can also access the healthcare data from the cloud servers in a secure way. The entire healthcare data is stored in a blockchain maintained by the cloud servers. A detailed formal security including the security verification of BAKMP-IoMT using the widely-accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool is performed to demonstrate its resilience against the different types of possible attack. The comparison of BAKMP-IoMT with relevant existing schemes is conducted which identifies that the proposed system furnishes better security and functionality, and also needs low communication and computational costs as compared to other schemes. Finally, the simulation of BAKMP-IoMT is conducted to demonstrate its impact on the performance parameters.},

The SDs can be allowed to use the wireless spectrum as long as the interference to the primary user is tolerated, and an eavesdropper in the network can overhear the confidential message from the SDs, which threatens the data offloading. For the considered system, we firstly present three optimization criteria, whereas criterion I aims to minimize the linear combination of latency and energy consumption, criterion II tries to minimize the latency under a constraint on the energy consumption, and criterion III is to minimize the energy consumption under a constraint on the latency. We then exploit a federated learning framework to solve these optimization problems, by optimizing the offloading ratio, bandwidth and computational capability allocation ratio. Simulation results are finally demonstrated to show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the system cost in terms of latency and energy consumption, and meanwhile ensure more bandwidth and computational capability allocated to the user with a higher taskpriority.},

	abstract = {The growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices generates massive amounts of diverse data, including personal or confidential information (i.e., sensory, images, etc.) that is not intended for public view. Traditionally, predefined privacy policies are usually enforced in resource-rich environments such as the cloud to protect sensitive information from being released. However, the massive amount of data streams, heterogeneous devices, and networks involved affects latency, and the possibility of having data intercepted grows as it travels away from the data source. Therefore, such data streams must be transformed on the IoT device or within available devices (i.e., edge devices) in its vicinity to ensure privacy. In this paper, we present a privacy-enforcing framework that transforms data streams on edge networks. We treat privacy close to the data source, using powerful edge devices to perform various operations to ensure privacy. Whenever an IoT device captures personal or confidential data, an edge gateway in the device’s vicinity analyzes and transforms data streams according to a predefined set of rules. How and when data is modified is defined precisely by a set of triggers and transformations - a privacy model - that directly represents a stakeholder’s privacy policies. Our work answered how to represent such privacy policies in a model and enforce transformations on the edge.},

Using biometric templates in Kerberos gives more reliability to client server architectures for analysis in distributed platform while dealing with sensitive and confidential information. Even today the companies face challenge of security of confidential data. Although the main focus of the development of hadoop, CDBMS like technologies was primarily oriented towards the big data analysis, data management and further conversion of huge chunks of raw data into useful information.

A cyber-predator may interact with or gather confidential data about children without being physically present if IoT toys are hacked. Authentication to verify user identity is essential for all internet-connected applications, where relying on single authentication is not considered safe, especially in children's applications. Children often use easy-to-guess passwords in smart applications associated with the Internet of Things (IoT) for children's toys. In this paper, we propose to activate multi-factor authentication on the IoTs for children's toys connected to the internet using companion applications. When changing the user's behaviour (by IP address, GPS, OS version, and browser), the child's identity must be verified by two-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized access to preserve the child's safety and privacy. This paper introduces multi-authentication mechanisms: a password and another authentication type, either mobile phone SMS, security token, digital certificate, or biometric authentication.},

Protecting the information is very important during communication because it is shared over the internet. This causes accessing of information by the unauthorized interceptors. Cryptography plays a major part in tools of security. It is a method that changes plain message into cipher form. In cloud computing, most of the researchers used the technique of either Symmetric key encryption or asymmetric encryption. In this paper a hybrid technique of using both Symmetric-key and Asymmetric-key algorithm is implemented to give strong security. Initially the original data is enciphered by OTP and the OTP keys are enciphered with RSA after that the encrypted key of OTP by RSA will be stored in the cloud. The receiver has to decrypt the encrypted OTP key first then the request for getting data encrypted with OTP is sent to the sender. The sender analyzes the user information and sends the encrypted data (with OTP) to the cloud with life span. The receiver gets the encrypted data and decrypted it using the already received key. If the receiver failed to retrieve the data within a life span period then he/she has to request again. Outcome of this method provides a better protection. Also the time taken to encipher the data is quicker than the already existing method. The attack of brute force is impossible for this method.},

	abstract = {Cloud Computing is an important term of modern technology. The usefulness of Cloud is increasing day by day and simultaneously more and more security problems are arising as well. Two of the major threats of Cloud are improper authentication and multi-tenancy. According to the specialists both pros and cons belong to multi-tenancy. There are security protocols available but it is difficult to claim these protocols are perfect and ensure complete protection. The purpose of this paper is to propose an integrated model to ensure better Cloud security for Authentication and multi-tenancy. Multi-tenancy means sharing of resources and virtualization among clients. Since multi-tenancy allows multiple users to access same resources simultaneously, there is high probability of accessing confidential data without proper privileges. Our model includes Kerberos authentication protocol to enhance authentication security. During our research on Kerberos we have found some flaws in terms of encryption method which have been mentioned in couple of IEEE conference papers. Pondering about this complication we have elected Elliptic Curve Cryptography. On the other hand, to attenuate arose risks due to multi-tenancy we are proposing a Resource Allocation Manager Unit, a Control Database and Resource Allocation Map. This part of the model will perpetuate resource allocation for the users.},

Next the feature extraction and face detection is done using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) algorithm that can extract local neighboring texture information of grey scale image and can efficiently differentiate between object and background. The extracted features are dimensionally reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm .The detected face is compared against the stored features and if there is a match the access is provided to the authorized person.

The updated model is sent to a server to be aggregated. FL is expected to be used extensively in wireless networks. Therefore, researchers are interested in optimizing Federated Learning for wireless networks. This paper aims to study the performance of FL in terms of accuracy and amount of data exchanged in a wireless network considering the impact of delay using different datasets. The accuracy of the FL model was found to be reliable when benchmarked to the centralized approach(less than 0.1 difference in accuracy). The data transfer size with FL was also significantly smaller than in the centralized approach for all the tested datasets.},

There are more chances to read the information that is being transferred through network of computers or internet by other people. Now a days most of the countries are affected Ransomware attack. To avoid this we need a secure way to protect our data. So to protect information, we need to encrypt/decrypt information by using cryptography algorithms. In cryptography the data which is to be transmitted from sender to receiver in the network must be encrypted using the encryption algorithm and receiver can view the original data by using decryption technique. Mostly used asymmetric key encryption algorithm is RSA, which uses two keys one for encryption and another for decryption. Long time for the encryption process is the disadvantage of RSA algorithm. To overcome this problem, this paper performs comparative analysis of three algorithms: RSA, short range natural number (SRNN) and two key pair algorithm considering parameters encryption/decryption time. The programs are implemented using JAVA library function. The class BigInteger is used to hold large prime numbers and keys so that it difficult for hacker to guess the data. The algorithms are executed successfully on different size of text files. Comparing the encryption time results using normal RSA algorithm, SRNN and two key pair algorithm, it was proved that SRNN algorithm takes less time for encryption.},

But there are several problems right now in IAIN Manado information system such as data loss, downtime system and some more. Therefore, this research tried to reduce the impact by implementing DRP. In this research two strategies were introduced that could help IAIN Manado implement DRP and preventive components on the main site as an initial precaution. All strategies are based on DRaaS in Microsoft Azure to help IAIN Manado ensure the availability of their systems.},

	abstract = {Protection for information assets is essential in safeguarding information security due to the threats on confidentiality, integrity, and availability in storing and using these assets. The Langlangbuana University requires protection on its information asset, its Academic Information System (AIS), which mostly manages confidential information for academic purposes. This study aims to conduct a risk-assessment on the AIS asset using the OCTAVE Allegro framework, as well as on the security control applications using the clauses of ISO 27002. As a result, the policies recommended by this study could be useful for the university's future improvements.},
