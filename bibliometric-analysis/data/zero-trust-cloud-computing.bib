	abstract = {Zero Trust security model permits to secure cloud native applications while encrypting all network communication, authenticating, and authorizing every request. The service mesh can enable Zero Trust using a side-car proxy without changes to the application code. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has provided a performance analysis of Zero Trust in a multi-cloud environment. This paper proposes a multi-cloud framework and a testing workflow to analyse performance of the data plane under load and the impact on the control plane, when Zero Trust is enabled. The results of preliminary tests show that Istio has reduced latency variability in responding to sequential HTTP requests. Results also reveal that the overall CPU and memory usage can increase based on service mesh configuration and the cloud environment.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing, a new health information exchange mode of personal health record (PHR) on cloud has become a hot topic. Many medical services are outsourced or provided by the third-party service provider, which is bound to lose direct control of the PHR files, while the cloud service provider may collude with other unauthorized users to disclose legitimate users' privacy in order to gain profits. At present, many scholars apply attribute encryption to cloud storage platform to ensure that PHR files are not transmitted in plaintext during the whole access process, but it cannot solve the semi-trust problem of cloud service providers and key distribution servers themselves. Therefore, in order to solve problem of data security and privacy protection of PHR data sharing scheme on semi-trusted servers, this paper introduces the security concept of “zero trust” to construct a data security access control framework based on zero trust and attribute encryption in the medical cloud. This framework can realize real-time monitoring and trust measurement of the behavior of the client and the server, and can dynamically adjust the access permissions of PHR user resources according to the measurement results. The security analysis results show that the proposed scheme can achieve more secure and reliable data access control in medical cloud.},

Majority of the work on this domain are vendor specific and not well covered from an enterprise security architecture point of view. This results in narrow focus and inconsistencies. The use of trust models to implement the "Never Trust" principle, and the "Always Verify" concept utilizing trusted computing techniques is our major contribution.

	abstract = {Zero Web of trust access is an IT security solution that provides secure remote access to organizational applications, data and services based on Well-defined expression access control policies. But in the cloud native scenario, the load reconfiguration strategy under the zero trust gateway and Microservices side vehicle model architecture needs to be solved urgently. Based on the understanding of the zero trust mechanism of cloud native Microservices system, this paper analyzes the genetic defects in the inherent mechanism of cloud native, especially the service governance framework mechanism, from a new perspective. These genetic defects will not disappear with the intergenerational development of mobile cloud native. Therefore, they are also known as the endogenous security common problems of cloud native. This article presents the endogenous security threats that may be introduced by security flaws such as "default information authenticity" and "ubiquitous data visibility". Guided by the theory of endogenous security in cyberspace, it proposes the idea and method of using "zero trust" to break the "default trust" and using "implicit mapping" to achieve "limited visibility" of user data to solve the common problems of cloud native endogenous security, And a new zero trust gateway architecture ecology and corresponding applicability function quantification load balancing strategy have been reconstructed. Experiments show that the zero trust architecture and quantification function proposed in this paper are progressiveness.},

Elliptic curve cryptography algorithm (ECC) is used to encrypt the data sent by the terminal and fog node, and the discrete logarithm dilemma of the algorithm is used to achieve identity authentication between “terminal, fog and cloud”. Paillier is used to encrypt and aggregate a large amount of data collected by power terminals. The simulation results show that the distributed deployment mode based on fog computing can effectively reduce the system load, and the behavior of abnormal terminals will significantly reduce the trust value.},

The study showed that there is an increased usage of zero trust in securing networks and protecting organizations from malicious cyber-attacks.

	abstract = {As cloud services gain in popularity, users around the world are increasingly using them in their daily lives to store and process their critical and sensitive data, such as ecommerce services, healthcare information, government data and more. The growing importance of cloud services makes cloud storage systems an excellent target for cybercrime and protecting them is an absolute must. The aim of this paper is to propose a new zero-trust based model for data storage in a multi-cloud environment. The proposed model considers the security and availability constraints of multi-cloud environments while respecting the zero-trust principle. Our model addresses growing security challenges as it requires users and services to verify their identity credentials before accessing corporate cloud resources. In this way, access to critical resources becomes more secure. Our model is adapted to modern cloud storage systems and makes user data more secure, in line with the famous quote “Never trust, always verify”.},

Aiming at the isolation of the internal network of the data center, the paper builds a more reliable system with the help of the zero-trust thought.

To process the data an increase in transmission, computing, storage and analysis capability is required. Utilising cloud computing to handle the increase in data could introduce high latency and increasing storage costs. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has become an essential component of the next generation 5G networks that provide improved reliability and low latency. This paper proposes a model that will enable MEC operators to collect information from the environment that can be analysed before making trust decisions. Trust is achieved by continuously applying authentication and authorisation while maintaining robust management practices to drive the trust decision process. The proposed model trusts the User Equipment (UE) only after verifying user credentials, which are converted into ciphertexts. The integration of different technologies such as computers, medical devices, and telecommunications will significantly improve the efficiency of patient treatment, reduce the cost of health care and improve privacy and security. Trust decisions are based on the trust posture criteria, existing and potential trust relationships, and the MEC environment trust state. The research outcomes show that this approach provides a positive improvement whilst establishing trust.},

We perform the log analysis process and develop an unsupervised recurrent deep neural net architecture which is widely used in recent log data anomaly detection for high performance computing and cloud computing infrastructure. This approach may perform well in previous use cases but its never been arranged for Apache Access log data.

Traditional trust evaluation methods cannot achieve accurate and reliable trust evaluation. This paper proposes a sustainable trust evaluation method under the zero-trust architecture. First, according to the data generated by the user's operation in the mobile application, the sentiment analysis of the user's text interaction information is carried out to establish a more reasonable trust evaluation model. Secondly, classic clustering algorithms and residual networks are used to learn the collected data. When the learning accuracy is stable, the algorithm can predict the trustworthiness of subsequent behaviors. Finally, when predicting future data, loading the previously trained model can achieve sustainability. Experimental simulation shows that the trust evaluation model and algorithm can effectively judge whether the user's operation is trustworthy within a period, and achieve a more reasonable and efficient sustainable trust evaluation.},

This article explores the design and implementation of this technology through research and application. Firstly, this article introduces the basic principles and characteristics of the zero trust model. This model no longer assumes the credibility of any internal or external resources, but implements access control of resources through multiple authentication, permission grading, and dynamic policies. Then, this article proposes an access control framework based on the zero trust model to address security challenges in grid cloud environments, and provides a detailed description of the functions and roles of each component. In the implementation process, this article uses technical means based on identity verification, authentication tokens, and access policies, combined with the characteristics of the grid cloud environment, to design a secure access control system. This system achieves authentication of users and resources, dynamic updates of hierarchical authorization and access control rules, thereby ensuring the security and credibility of grid cloud services. The experimental results indicate that the security access control system effectively prevents unauthorized access and potential security risks in grid cloud environments. Through the application of multiple authentication and dynamic access control policies, the system can timely identify and respond to security threats, and achieve fine-grained access control for cloud services..},

The application of zero-trust principles addresses known security issues such as lateral movement attacks but adds extra identity management complexity. In addition, to cover a broader range of attacks, one must think of strategies to protect data, code, and credentials in such applications. Confidential computing aims to fulfill this goal. Nevertheless, confidential computing is even more complex to implement than Zero-Trust. In this work, we combine the Zero-Trust model with confidential computing by leveraging the SPIFFE standard through its reference implementation (SPIRE), and Intel SGX through the SCONE framework, to seamlessly supply software identities to confidential microservices. Furthermore, we also protected the whole identity-provisioning stack with Intel SGX and assessed the performance overhead. We believe this combination not only improves the security of SPIFFE deployments but also leverages SPIFFE to facilitate the integration between confidential computing components and native applications.},

	abstract = {Recently, remote work has become popular due to the widespread of infectious diseases. Many organizations and companies have turned to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) in an attempt to provide secure remote access to their on-premises infrastructure. However, intensive access to such VPN devices places a heavy burden on network performance, and there is also a high risk of cyber-attacks targeting them. Therefore, the demand for zero trust architecture without using VPN devices is increasing these days. However, it takes much time for organizations to introduce a zero trust architecture. Furthermore, it is difficult for some organizations to implement the so-called “ideal zero trust environment” because of some security problems and confidential information management. Thus, it is expected that a hybrid environment in which a zero trust architecture and a conventional on-premises environment coexist is introduced at first in many organizations. In this environment, access logs for each service are distributed in both cloud and on-premise servers. Thus, conventional log-based anomaly detection methods will not work well. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting unauthorized access to such a hybrid environment using machine learning and verify its effectiveness in a virtual environment. As a result, we detect abnormal behavior with high accuracy. Furthermore, based on the experimental results, we discuss how logs should be collected and what kind of log information is useful for anomaly detection in hybrid environments.},

However, the current Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) mainly focuses on the network security and lacks in-depth considerations on system-level security policies and abstractions, which leaves the realization of the principle incomplete. To bridge the gap, we propose an innovative programmable system security framework called SYS FLOW to enable unified, dynamic, and fine-grained Zero Trust security control for system resources. SYS FLOW introduces a novel system flow abstraction to model system activities across the entire infrastructure, and provides a system-level data plane and control plane separation and abstraction. The new logically centralized controller accommodates a unified programmable Policy Decision Point (PDP) that acquires a holistic view of system behaviors for controlling system resource accesses by translating programmable security policies into system flow rules. The SYS FLOW data plane, acting as Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), enforces translated system flow rules, which can be updated dynamically and facilitate fine-grained responsive actions. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of SYS FLOW, which addresses the security issues in various scenarios with a minor performance overhead.},

Cloud resources and services are available in pay-as-you-go mode, which brings extraordinary flexibility and cost-effectiveness as well as zero investment in their own computing infrastructure. However, these advantages come at a price-people no longer have direct control over their own data. Based on this view, data security becomes a major concern in the adoption of cloud computing. Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) is essential to a security system that is based on high efficiency symmetric-key encryption. With virtualization technology being applied, existing key exchange schemes such as Internet Key Exchange (IKE) becomes time-consuming when directly deployed into cloud computing environment. In this paper we propose a novel hierarchical key exchange scheme, namely Cloud Background Hierarchical Key Exchange (CBHKE). Based on our previous work, CBHKE aims at providing secure and efficient scheduling for cloud computing environment. In our new scheme, we design a two-phase layer-by-layer iterative key exchange strategy to achieve more efficient AKE without sacrificing the level of data security. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that when deployed in cloud computing environment, efficiency of the proposed scheme is dramatically superior to its predecessors CCBKE and IKE schemes.},

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) provides abstractions of core network functions from the vendor-specific hardware. This allows the network functions to move around the cloud, providing better performance and scaling capabilities. However, deploying virtualized mobile core network in the cloud environment opens many security concerns not only regarding communication between the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the mobile core network but also within the core network itself. In this paper, we propose a framework called virtual Evolved Packet Core - virtual Software Defined Perimeter (vEPC-vSDP) to provide secure communications within the mobile core network by using an authentication-based approach. The SDP components are virtualized and placed within the virtualized core network to provide a zero-trust environment where only authenticated and authorized core network elements can have access to one another. The analysis of the proposed vEPC-vSDP framework confirms its ability to shield the core network traffic from both external and internal attacks. The vEPC-vSDP framework was implemented and tested against Denial of Service (DoS), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and port scanning attacks to demonstrate the resilience of the proposed framework. The results show the capability of vEPC-vSDP to provide secure communication path to mobile core network elements.},

OF@TEIN playground over TEIN (Trans-Eurasia Information Network), is a multi-site cloud with distributed edge nodes has brought the security challenges. In order to address the security challenges of distributed edge nodes, recently, SmartX Multi-Sec framework has been launched. However, it is based on a signature-based network threat detection mechanism. Depending on the current complex and heterogeneous nature of network traffic which is continuously increasing in scale, machine learning capabilities are more effective to recognize hidden and complex patterns of network traffic than traditional signature-based methods. Moreover, in response to the weaknesses of current security solutions, the zero-trust model manipulates that no network is reliable. Therefore, cloud operators should monitor and verify all network traffic continuously. So, by considering the above challenges, we are going to enhance the SmartX Multi-Sec framework by focusing on zero trust and incorporating machine learning techniques for network threat detection (specifically DDoS attacks). Moreover, its prototype version has been realized on the OF@TEIN playground to show its effectiveness.},

The benefits of this open source software for private clouds are highly efficient scalability, organization agility, and increased trust and control for IT. These studies perform tests on performance of the services of websites by using performance test tools - LoadUI and Web Performance Load Tester with some security issues purposed. The six evaluation of the performance tests are 1) average response time 2) peak response time 3) error rate of data transmission 4) throughput 5) request service per second and 6) amount of concurrent user in the system. By comparing performances with dedicated server (not on cloud), the test results from these two programs show average response time of website on cloud server is less than website on dedicated server, peak response time of website on cloud server is less than website on dedicated server, error rate of data transmission is zero on both website on cloud server and dedicated server, throughput of website on cloud server is higher than website on dedicated server, request service per second of website on cloud server is higher than website on dedicated server and amount of concurrent user in the system of website on cloud server is higher than website on dedicated server.},

	abstract = {The cloud-based Internet-of-Things (IoT) has been applied to support ubiquitous data collection and centralized data processing among various applications. Equipped with powerful resources, a semi-trusted cloud is able to deduce private information by launching inference attack. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has been proposed as an effective way to preserve privacy from inference attack while allowing certain computation over ciphertext. However, HE leads to longer latency due to additional communication and computation overheads. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework in privacy-preserving access control under cloud-fog computing systems. The optimization goal is to maximize the average user satisfaction in the system, where cost and latency serve as key metrics measuring user satisfaction. Due to the NP-hardness of the formulated problem, we propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm to solve it, where the access offloading decision making, user cooperation, and resource allocation are considered. Simulation results are presented to show the advantages of our proposed algorithm in terms of the average USI (User Satisfaction Index) and the number of users with zero USI.},

In addition, data collected by and sent from IoT devices may be shared with and processed by edge computing systems, in order to reduce the reliance on centralized (cloud) servers, leading to further security and privacy issues. To cope with these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative blockchain-enabled information sharing solution in zero-trust context to guarantee anonymity yet entity authentication, data privacy yet data trustworthiness, and participant stimulation yet fairness. This new solution is able to support filtering of fabricated information through smart contracts, effective voting, and consensus mechanisms, which can prevent unauthenticated participants from sharing garbage information. We also prove that the proposed solution is secure in the universal composability framework, and further evaluate its performance over an Ethereum-based blockchain platform to demonstrate its utility.},

Sub-modular and disjoint cluster sets increase connectivity performance of analytical systems. Unified batch/interactive/ad-hoc querying can enable trusted E2E (end-to-end) analytics for massive systems. Trust factor and trust cost optimization reinforce the trustworthiness of the overall system in varying context. However, security and privacy architectures are still context dependent. Dynamic change in a context have to be adapted to all system layers in real-time for a complete E2E trust mechanism and confidence in smart-ecosystems.In this study, we explored dynamic security and privacy aspects of E2E analytical transactions in varying context. Classical behavior modelling approaches; such as, cellular automata, chaotic systems, hierarchical block diagram modeling methods are cumbersome to adapt the dynamism. Persisting and ensuring the trust for varying contexts with an E2E trust mechanism enable to adapt the dynamism at massive scale. Initial arguments for data exchange over a hybrid-cloud node, instead of cell unit scenario in a simulated 5G environment with the trust mechanism, is evaluated. It is promising to meet zero latency requirement of MEC (Multi-access/Mobile Edge Computing) units. So that, we can say that transmitting data over a hybrid-cloud node rather than cell units can maximize mobility of 5/6G ecosystem with the E2E trust mechanism.},

In response to these attacks, regulators have suggested building systems on the principles of “zero-trust”, an aspirational motto that urges system designers to take measures to minimize trust. But, to what degree can one minimize trust in realistic systems? The answer to this question, of course, depends on the context. In this paper, we explore this question in the context of a satellite ground station front end processor – a critical component in satellite ground stations, in both standalone and cloud settings. Based on our design and implementation experience that spanned 18 months, we observe that it is possible to achieve a significant reduction in trust as measured by the lines of code. We also find that minimizing the lines of code improves productivity and the performance of our design. Finally, we find trust can be minimized to a greater extent for standalone systems than cloud systems.},

Modern networks increasingly need to integrate virtual network components that exist outside of the organization and often exist within multiple different cloud-based systems. These virtual network components are operated most efficiently when they operate within a single network management domain, traditionally achieved via castle-and-moat network perimeter. SDPN integrates the multi-plane management model (data, control, and application planes) and core functionality of the Software-defined Perimeter (SDP) and the Software-defined Network (SDN) paradigms with Zero Trust security principles to create a single virtual network perimeter. In the control plane, the SDPN controller combines SDP controller and SDN controller functionality into one logical controller. The SDPN controller also introduces trust as the trust anchor via a root certificate issued by a trusted third-party. At the data layer, servers, devices, and network functions are simplified into nodes. The SDPN controller manages every node in the perimeter via a control channel. The SDPN framework provides for Zero Trust security both within and beyond a managed network domain while reducing the attack surface, securing network flows, and enabling simple network management.},

The gradual opening of the power mobile service system has made the network boundary increasingly blurred. The interaction of various services puts forward higher requirements for the flexibility, accuracy, and moderation of user identity authentication. Existing authentication methods assume that the users, equipment, and processes of the intranet are credible, and lack corresponding technical means in terms of risk prevention and control. Combining dynamic and static authentication methods, this paper proposes a multi-level intelligent identity authentication scheme under the zero-trust architecture. This solution realizes the two-way authentication between the user and the server in the mobile internet service. Compared with the existing scheme, this scheme conducts continuous trust assessment and risk prevention for users based on static authentication and constructs a two-way authentication protocol between the user and the server based on attribute encryption. Security analysis shows that this solution realizes the security authentication between the subject to be authenticated and the server, guarantees the confidentiality of the authentication ciphertext, and can resist forgery attacks.},

As the world is advancing digitally, mobile and cloud services have become the principal drivers of this era. The conventional frameworks to protect such an environment have dissolved. There existed a period where organization resources were put away inside the secure perimeter and regarded as safe. Moreover, the recent work-from-home culture provides attackers with a rather significant opportunity to breach security controls. Everybody is deemed trustworthy inside the network, allowing an intruder to gain escalated access inside the perimeter. These fortresses currently permit clients to get sustained information from outside the fortification since everybody is `trusted excessively.' making our current foundation defenseless to attackers. This paper proves `Zero Trust' as another worldview of online protection. It explores the previous work related to Zero Trust implementation and its research. It discusses Zero Trust as a potential for future network security. It uses containers to implement the architecture, which responds to various types of attacks. It focuses on security at every OSI model layer and the advantages and disadvantages of Zero Trust Architecture.},

Our approach does not require any expert security and web service knowledge to create a secure instance. The approach allows non-experts to launch web-accessible virtual machine services that are automatically secured through OAuth2 authentication, an authentication standard widely employed in academic and enterprise environments. We demonstrate the approach through an example of creating secure commercial cloud instances of the MIT SuperCloud modern research computing oriented software stack. A small example of a use case is examined and compared with native MIT SuperCloud experience as a preliminary evaluation. The example illustrates several useful features. It retains OAuth2 security guarantees and leverages a simple OAuth2 proxy architecture that in turn employs simple DNS based service limits to manage access to the proxy service. The system has the potential to provide a default secure environment in which access is, in theory, limited to a narrow trust circle. It leverages WebSockets to provide a pure browser enabled, zero install base service. For the user, it is entirely self-service so that a non-expert, non-privileged user can launch instances, while supporting access to a familiar environment on a broad selection of hardware, including high-end GPUs and isolated bare-metal resources. The environment includes pre-configured browser based desktop GUI and notebook configurations. It can provide the option of end-user privileged access to the VM for flexible customization. It integrates with a simplified cost-monitoring and machine management framework that provides visibility to commercial cloud charges and some budget guard rails, and supports instance stop, restart, and pausing features to allow intermittent use and cost reduction.},

Wired network with fixed infrastructure defense against attacks using firewalls and gateways, nevertheless for wireless network with dynamic structure attacks can come from anywhere and at any time, because mobile nodes are unguarded to security attacks. To ensure secure data transmission and for proper functioning of network operations trustworthiness of the node has to be proved before initiating any group activity. When MANET nodes are used for large scale operations, dynamic nature of the MANET induces many problems in terms of routing delay, bandwidth and resource consumption. Consequently many clustering algorithms invented by researchers for betterment of MANET resources. With this objective trust based clustering is used to divide the whole network into sub groups based on trust value. The trustworthiness of the node is evaluated by direct trust evaluation technique and the trust value at each node is calculated as fuzzy value and it lies in between zero and one. The sub group(cluster) security is ensured by electing trustworthy node as Cluster Head(CH). Finally the proposed Trust based Clustering Algorithm(TBCA) is proved its superiority with existing Enhanced Distributed Weighted Clustering Algorithm(EDWCA) based on some metrics like delay, PDR, packet drop and overhead etc.},

	abstract = {Virtualization is a technology pervading various application domains, spanning nowadays from cloud computing to embedded systems. One of the most important features in virtualization is the possibility of data/memory sharing between virtual machines, between the host system, virtual machines. Such capability is as an example extremely important in the para-virtualization of programmable parallel accelerators, such as GPUs, where huge memory buffers are allocated in virtual machines, need to be shared with the actual device in order to be processed. Various techniques enable the communication between the guest, the host, but most of them are designed to exchange small amounts of data, or rely on a socket-based paradigm where a copy of the data is performed between guest, host adding the need for serialization/de-serialization of data at each endpoint. Data copies, serialization/de-serialization are a major source of overhead in virtualization, especially in the embedded domain where lower performance processors are used. This work presents a zero-copy shared memory mechanism for host-guest memory sharing in KVM. The zero-copy framework exploits features of the KVM hypervisor to let a host application map a memory buffer allocated in the guest environment. This feature leads to a zero-overhead communication, thus helps reducing the overall overhead of software based virtualization techniques. This paper will also introduce a use case scenario for the exploitation of the zero-copy framework,, present some preliminary performance results.},

	abstract = {Zero Trust Networking (ZTN) is a security model where no entity in a network infrastructure is trusted. The first bastion of security for achieving ZTN is to have strong identity verification. Several standard methods for assuring a robust identity exist (E.g., OAuth2.0, OpenID Connect). These standards employ the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) during the authentication process. However, the use of JWT for One Time Token (OTT) enrollment has a latent security issue. A JWT can be intercepted by a third party and the information of the payload can be exposed, revealing the details of the enrollment server. Furthermore, an intercepted JWT could be used for enrollment by an impersonator as long as the JWT remains active. Our proposed mechanism aims to secure the ownership of the OTT by including the JWT as encrypted metadata into a Non-Fungible Token (NFT). The mechanism uses the blockchain Public Key of the intended owner for encrypting the JWT, and the blockchain assures the JWT ownership by mapping it to the intended owner's blockchain public address. Our proposed mechanism is applied to an emerging Zero Trust framework (OpenZiti) alongside a permissioned Ethereum blockchain using Hyperledger Besu. The Zero Trust Framework provides the enrollment functionality, while our proposed mechanism based on blockchain and NFT assures the secure distribution of OTTs that is used for the enrollment of identities.},

SDP has been considered as a zero-trust model against the increase of internal fraud and other problems in traditional perimeter networks. In SDP, the SDP controller authenticates and authorizes the connection between the user and the service for each service provision, thereby ensuring a secure state at any time. At the same time, as the IoT progresses, it is expected to function as a user-side terminal for SDP. In general, it is difficult to ensure the security of the IoT itself due to the lack of resources such as CPU power and storage in the IoT. When the IoT is incorporated as a user terminal of SDP, it is essential to ensure the reliability of the IoT, but such research is not sufficient. In this paper, we describe a method for incorporating IoT into SDP usage terminals. Specifically, we discussed the use of IoT gateways, client certificates, and IdPs as methods to compensate for the lack of IoT resources. As a result of qualitative evaluation by desk evaluation, the method using IdP was found to be the most effective.},

However, the zero-trust edge computing platform is highly challenged by the growing concern on security and privacy. Thus, Trust Execution Environment (TEE), like TrustZone, is advocated to empower edge clouds to enable secure task offloading. To explore TrustZone, the inevitable involvement of data encryption and decryption operations makes existing offloading strategies not applicable any more, especially when the task dependency is considered. In addition, TrustZone has distinguishable task scheduling paradigm as one CPU core does not allow multitask coexist at the same time. Taking the above issues into consideration, we investigate a dependency-aware task offloading problem for makespan minimization in TrustZone empowered edge clouds. By inventing an extended graph to describe the task execution process, we provide a formal statement to the problem and prove its NP-hardness. We then propose a Customized List Scheduling (CLS) based approximate algorithm and theoretically analyze its achievable performance. Extensive testbed based experiment results show that our approximation algorithm can effectively reduce the makespan and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art offloading approaches in TrustZone empowered edge clouds.},

While numerous attempts have been made to protect against the potential attacks, there are still many unsolved problems such as developing a fine-grained access control system. This is reflected by the granularity of security as well as the related data that are hosted on these platforms. Among the most notable trends is the increased usage of smart devices, IoV, cloud services, emerging technologies aim at accessing, storing and processing data. Most popular authentication protocols rely on knowledge-factor for authentication that is infamously known to be vulnerable to subversions. Recently, the zero-trust framework has drawn huge attention; there is an urgent need to develop further the existing Continuous Authentication (CA) technique to achieve the zero-trustiness framework. In this paper, firstly, we develop the static authentication process and propose a secured protocol to generate the smart key for user to unlock the vehicle. Then, we proposed a novel and secure continuous authentication system for IoVs. We present the proof-of-concept of our CA scheme by building a prototype that leverages the commodity fingerprint sensors, NFC, and smartphone. Our evaluations in real-world settings demonstrate the appropriateness of CA scheme and security analysis of our proposed protocol for digital key suggests its enhanced security against the known attack-vector.},

	abstract = {Existing attestation mechanisms lack scalability and support for heterogeneous virtual execution environments (VEEs), such as virtual machines and containers executed inside or outside hardware isolation on different vendors' hardware in clouds managed by various organizations. To overcome these limitations, hardware vendors and cloud providers implement proprietary mechanisms (Intel DCAP, Amazon NitroTPM, Google Titan) to support their offerings. However, due to their plurality, the attestation becomes cumbersome because it increases maintenance and integration costs and reduces portability required in hybrid- and multi-cloud deployments. We introduce WAWEL, a framework that enables scalable attestation of heterogeneous VEEs. WAWEL can be plugged into existing hardware-specific attestation mechanisms, offering a unified interface. WAWEL supports the widely adopted trusted platform module (TPM) attestation standard. We implemented a prototype and integrated it with three different VEEs. It supports runtime integrity attestation with Linux integrity measurement architecture (IMA) and legacy applications requiring zero-code changes. The evaluation demonstrated that the WAWEL prototype achieves very good performance and scalability despite the indirections between the VEE and hardware root of trust.},

The privacy methods studied in previous research showed that privacy infringement for cloud computing or big data happened because multi risks on data by external or internal attackers. An important risk to take into consideration when speaking of the privacy of the stored transactions is represented by the transactions' information which is not in the owner's control. Such a case is represented by the cloud servers that are administered by cloud providers which cannot be wholly trusted by the users with sensitive, private data such as business plans or private information. A simple method for protecting data privacy is by applying certain privacy techniques onto transactions' data, followed by the upload of the modified data into the cloud. In this paper, we are proposing a case study that is built on levels containing three models: cloud's architecture, transaction's manager and clients. Moreover, we consider that our case study is based on the premise of zero trust among the three models, therefore all the transactions take place with third-parties and the data movements are realized going through various levels of security.},

In this research, we monitor account's behavior such clickstreams on the browser and incorporate it to evaluation of user's trust in access control system. Through the construction of behavior-based ZTAC system based on clickstreams, we have achieved access control that considers the naturalness of clicks without relying on the results of authentication. Moreover, toward solving the mismatch of click count between the system side and the end-user side, we synchronously updated the clickstream by the user-agent which observing and retrieving the click events in the DOM. As experimental evaluation, we verified that our ZTAC can deal with click count discrepancy and completely prevent various insider threat to sensitive data from even authenticated accounts. Also, we confirmed no significant differences in response time, memory usage, or CPU usage before and after the migration of zero-trust, indicating that it can be deployed in existing enterprise networks.},

	abstract = {The existing high-friction device onboarding process hinders the promise and potentiality of Internet of Things (IoT). Even after several attempts by various device manufacturers and working groups, no widely adopted standard solution came to fruition. The latest attempt by Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance [2] promises a ‘zero touch’ solution for mass market IoT customers, but the burden is transferred to the intermediary supply chain (i.e. they have to maintain infrastructure for managing keys and digital signatures called ‘Ownership Voucher’ for all devices). The specification relies on a ‘Rendezvous Server’ mimicking the notion of ‘Domain Name System (DNS) server’. This essentially means resurrecting all existing possible attack scenarios associated with DNS, which include Denial of Service (DoS) attack, and Correlation attack. ‘Ownership Voucher’ poses the risk that some intermediary supply chain agents may act maliciously and reject the transfer of ownership or sign with a wrong key. Furthermore, the deliberate use of the weak elliptic curve SECP256r1/SECP384r1 (also known as NIST P-256/384) [3] in the specification raises questions. As part of the ongoing work under the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research funded project PHY2APP [1], we introduce ASOP: a sovereign and secure device onboarding protocol for IoT devices without blindly trusting the device manufacturer, supply chain, and cloud service provider. The ASOP protocol allows onboarding an IoT device to a cloud server with the help of an authenticator owned by the user. This paper outlines the preliminary development of the protocol and its high-level description. Our ‘zero-trust’ and ‘human-in-the-loop’ approach guarantees that the device owner does not remain at the mercy of third-party infrastructures, and it utilises recently standardized post-quantum cryptographic suite (CRYSTALS) to secure connection and messages.},

	abstract = {Recent security threats against cyber-physical critical power grid infrastructures have further distinguished the differences and complex interdependencies between optimal plant control and infrastructural safety topics. In this paper, we reflect upon few real-world scenarios and threats to understand how those two topics meet. We then propose a practical architectural solutions to address the corresponding concerns. As a first concrete step, we focus on networked industrial control systems in smart grid where several sensing-processing-actuation embedded nodes receive information, make control decisions, and carry out optimal actions. Traditionally, global safety maintenance, e.g., transient stability, is embedded into control and taken into account by the decision making modules. With recent cyber security-induced safety incidents, we believe that the safety-handling modules should also be considered as a part of global trusted computing base (attack surface) for security purposes. Generally, maximizing the system's overall security requires the designers to minimize its trusted computing base. Consequently, we argue that the traditional combined safety-control system architecture is not anymore the optimal design paradigm to follow given existing threats. Instead, we propose PLCLOUD, a new cloud-based safety-preserving architecture that places a minimal trusted safety verifier layer between the physical world and the cyber-based supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure, specifically programmable logic controllers (PLCs). PLCLOUD's main objective is to take care of infrastructural safety and separate it from optimal plant control that SCADA is responsible for.},

To accomplish this, we first utilize two unexploited characteristics of WiFi radio signal strength to generate logical floor graph,, then formulate the problem of constructing fingerprint map in terms of a graph isomorphism problem between logical floor graph, physical floor graph. Then, a Bayesian-based approach is utilized to estimate the unknown subarea in online localization. The proposed method has been implemented in a real-world shopping mall, extensive experimental results show that our method can achieve competitive performance comparing with existing methods.},

During the past decade, LBSs have become more popular as a result of the widespread use of mobile devices with position functions. Location information is a secondary information that can provide personal insight about one's life. This issue associated with sharing of data in cloud-based locations. For example, a hospital is a public space and the actual location of the hospital does not carry any sensitive information. However, it may become sensitive if the specialty of the hospital is analyzed. In this paper we proposed design presents a combination of methods for providing data privacy protection for location-based services (LBSs) with the use of cloud service. The work built in zero trust and we start to manage the access to the system through different levels. The proposal is based on a model that stores user location data in supplementary servers and not in non-trustable third-party applications. The approach of the present research is to analyze the privacy protection possibilities through data partitioning. The data collected from the different recourses are distributed into different servers according to the partitioning model based on multi-level policy. Access is granted to third party applications only to designated servers and the privacy of the user profile is also ensured in each server, as they are not trustable.},

As such, there is a growing trend towards the open availability of research data, as researchers continue to enhance reproducibility by enabling sharing and opening of their findings and datasets. However, there is not yet a standardised way to openly enable access to datasets while keeping control of their final use, potentially obtaining benefits from their utilisation. This paper introduces Smardy, an EU-funded project which is deploying a traceable FAIR-compliant open innovation marketplace for data. Its innovative method for data exchange consists of the use of blockchain for controlling access rights to data, with data models able to grant access according to policies completely kept under the control of the data owner/producer. We also describe how Smardy employs dimensionality reduction techniques to automatically generate FAIR–compliant metadata, statistical fingerprinting to identify derivated datasets, and watermarking to help data owners trace the distribution of multiple copies of a dataset.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of lossy outsourcing, i.e., clients outsource computation needs to the cloud side through lossy channels, which is very common in practice. We focus on the case that the clients transmit 2D sparse signals to the semi-trusted clouds over packet-loss networks, and the clouds provide sparse robustness decoding service (SRDS) for the users. In order to achieve high level of efficiency and security, we propose to jointly exploit parallel compressive sensing for robust signal encoding and employ multiple cloud servers for SRDS. Specifically, prior to encoding, a signal is encrypted by only altering the indices and amplitudes of its non-zero entries. The encrypted signal is sensed using a Gaussian measurement matrix and the generated compressive measurements are then sent to multi-clouds for SRDS, along with the occurrence of packet loss. Each column in compressive measurements can be regarded as a packet and each description consists of a certain number of packets. Each description together with a small portion of support set is distributed to a cloud. When receiving the request from a user, each cloud performs SRDS using the acquired description, where the reconstructed signal is still in encrypted form so that the signal privacy is well preserved. After receiving the reconstructed signal, the user accomplishes the decryption operation. Experimental results show that the encryption algorithm improves compressibility and reconstruction performance compared with the case of no encryption, and the proposed privacy-assured outsourcing of SRDS is highly robust and efficient.},

IBBE-SGX builds upon Identity-Based Broadcasting Encryption (IBBE). We address IBBE's impracticality for cloud deployments by exploiting Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to derive cuts in the computational complexity. Moreover, we propose a group partitioning mechanism such that the computational cost of membership update is bound to a fixed constant partition size rather than the size of the whole group. We have implemented and evaluated our new access control extension. Results highlight that IBBE-SGX performs membership changes 1.2 orders of magnitude faster than the traditional approach of Hybrid Encryption (HE), producing group metadata that are 6 orders of magnitude smaller than HE, while at the same time offering zero knowledge guarantees.},

	abstract = {Advances in computing, communications, sensors, and cloud computing have resulted in the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) which forms a foundation for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Cyber-physical attacks can cause tangible effects in the physical world. The attacker's goal is to disrupt the normal operations of the CPS for example: equipment overstress, safety limits violation, damage to the product quality, safety compliance violation etc. The continued rise of cyber-attacks together with the evolving skills of the attackers, and the inefficiency of the traditional security algorithms to defend against advanced and sophisticated attacks such as Distributed Denial of service (DDoS), slow DoS and zero-day, necessitate the development of novel defense and resilient detection techniques compared to traditional approaches like signature and behavior-based methods. To deal with this, we propose a novel approach for learning detection model that includes operational and network data to detect advanced attacks. More precisely, our approach is able to learn a relational network that connects events at different system layers so that attacks can be identified with higher confidence level. In this paper, we propose a decision model by learning a set of constraints/relations from the data that conjunctively defines the normal operation of a CPS. The solutions of the decision model characterize the normal states of a given CPS. The malicious operations are detected when one or more constraints fail for a given state of CPS. The results demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach. The main advantage of our approach is the interpretability of the model.},

In this article, we propose a security awareness and protection system that leverages zero-trust architecture for a 5G-based smart medical platform. Driven by the four key dimensions of 5G smart healthcare including “subject” (i.e., users, terminals, and applications), “object” (i.e., data, platforms, and services), “behavior,” and “environment,” our system constructs trustable dynamic access control models and achieves real-time network security situational awareness, continuous identity authentication, analysis of access behavior, and fine-grained access control. The proposed security system is implemented and tested thoroughly at industrial-grade, which proves that it satisfies the needs of active defense and end-to-end security enforcement of data, users, and services involved in a 5G-based smart medical system.},

	abstract = {The Zero Trust (ZT) paradigm has recently emerged. The core idea of ZT is never to trust but always authenticate. By incorporating ZT into network architectures, neither users nor service providers need to trust each other, which significantly enhances the security level of these architectures. Cloud-based facial authentication is one of the plausible access control solutions to bring ZT into network architectures. Many of the state-of-art works on encrypted cloud-based authentication use Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to protect users’ private data. FHE enables a cloud server to perform arithmetic operations on encrypted inputs without decrypting them but with a significant computing overhead. In this work, we introduce novel approaches to incorporate Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) into cloud-based facial authentication by changing the distance metric from Euclidean distance to Manhattan distance. As a result, we reduce the computational overhead by a factor ranging from 20 to 55. In addition, we propose a novel two-stage architecture for group facial recognition, which can further reduce the total computation cost of authentications required to identify an individual from a crowd. Compared with conventional facial recognition methods, to find people of interest, group facial verification can cut the cost of calculating facial recognition by 55\%. With such a lightweight design, FaceGroup is scalable and can be deployed on resource-constrained devices.},

	abstract = {Research on the design of data center infrastructure is increasing, both from academia and industry, due to the rapid development of cloud-based applications such as search engines, social networks, and large-scale computing. On a large scale, data centers can consist of hundreds to thousands of servers that require systems with high-performance requirements and low downtime. To meet the network's needs in a dynamic data center, infrastructure of applications and services are growing. It takes a process of designing a network topology so that it can guarantee availability and security. One way to surmount this is by implementing the zero trust security model based on micro-segmentation. Zero trust is a security idea based on the principle of "never trust, always verify" in which no concepts of trust and untrust in network traffic. The zero trust security model implemented network traffic in the form of untrust. Micro-segmentation is a way to achieve zero trust by dividing a network into smaller logical segments to restrict the traffic. In this research, data center network performance based on software-defined networking with zero trust security model using micro-segmentation has been evaluated using a testbed simulation of Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure by measuring the round trip time, jitter, and packet loss during experiments. Performance evaluation results show that micro-segmentation adds an average round trip time of 4 μs and jitter of 11 μs without packet loss so that the security can be improved without significantly affecting network performance on the data center.},

In this paper, we explore a decentralized anonymous file system that can help someone talk privately with anyone he/she wishes. We propose a technological solution AnonFS that runs over an anonymous overlay network such as Tor and I2P. With the use of Tor or I2P, AnonFS inherits the property of Anonymity of connection. AnonFS is zero-trust cloud storage for synchronization. One can share content or even synchronize with multiple devices using AnonFS. AnonChat works by initiating a direct connection from one Tor/I2P peer to another Tor/I2P peer. AnonChat uses AnonFS to store and retrieve data anonymously. The identity of the user is never tied to any physical entity such as email ID, phone number, IP address, or any other personally identifiable information. This means that if the user is really careful about whom he shares the information with, AnonChat can be completely untraceable. We qualitatively compare AnonFS with several popular services.},

	abstract = {The 5G ecosystem is designed as a highly sophisticated and modularized architecture that decouples the radio access network (RAN), the multi-access edge computing (MEC) and the mobile core to enable different and scalable deployments. It leverages modern principles of virtualized network functions, microservices-based service chaining, and cloud-native software stacks. Moreover, it provides built-in security and mechanisms for slicing. Despite all these capabilities, there remain many gaps and opportunities for additional capabilities to support end-to-end secure operations for applications across many domains. Although 5G supports mechanisms for network slicing and tunneling, new algorithms and mechanisms that can adapt network slice configurations dynamically to accommodate urgent and mission-critical traffic are needed. Such slices must be secure, interference-aware, and free of side channel attacks. Resilience of the 5G ecosystem itself requires an effective means for observability and (semi-)autonomous self-healing capabilities. To address this plethora of challenges, this paper presents the SECurity and REsiliency TEchniques for Differentiated 5G OPerationS (SECRETED 5G OPS) project, which is investigating fundamental new solutions that center on the zero trust, network slicing, and network augmentation dimensions, which together will achieve secure and differentiated operations in 5G networks. SECRETED 5G OPS solutions are designed to be easily deployable, minimally invasive to the existing infrastructure, not require modifications to user equipment other than possibly firmware upgrades, economically viable, standards compliant, and compliant to regulations.},

This paper is focused on electrochemical storage elements; their modeling in order to choose the best one in term of efficiency and lifetime. To simulate their behavior in the context of BIPV, a simple model must be designed to take into account the complexity of the system.

In this paper, we propose a method to solve the problem of multi-resident activity recognition with the previously unseen activity classes. Our method utilizes the techniques of multi-task learning and zero-shot learning. It regards the activity recognition of each resident as a learning task, and learns all tasks jointly. By utilizing zero-shot learning techniques, previously unseen activity classes can be recognized. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.},

This design could be easily extended to the other aspects of a ground system such as mission planning, mission data processing, and ground terminals, but is being first implemented for the COSMOS C2 product. A ground system's security design needs to be resistant to both internal and external threats, while remaining performant and scalable to ever increasingly sized clusters of satellites. The following design takes a hybrid trust approach providing a level of zero-trust for internal connections, while also providing a strong level of security for external connections. The use of well-defined standards is critical to a robust security implementation. This design focuses on the use of JSON Web Token (JWT) which is an open standard established in RFC7519. The JWT tokens are distributed using the OpenID Connect protocol which is maintained by the OpenID Foundation. OpenID Connect hosted by a Single-Sign-On provider allows a single login to access multiple microservices. Finally, Infrastructure can be further protected by defining strong software communication rules. Any software/service that is not expected to connect to a microservice can be explicitly denied access by specifically defining rules as to what can talk to what. Istio is discussed as a technology to enforce these rules.},

NetVM allows customizable data plane processing capabilities such as firewalls, proxies, and routers to be embedded within virtual machines, complementing the control plane capabilities of Software Defined Networking. NetVM makes it easy to dynamically scale, deploy, and reprogram network functions. This provides far greater flexibility than existing purpose-built, sometimes proprietary hardware, while still allowing complex policies and full packet inspection to determine subsequent processing. It does so with dramatically higher throughput than existing software router platforms. NetVM is built on top of the KVM platform and Intel DPDK library. We detail many of the challenges we have solved such as adding support for high-speed inter-VM communication through shared huge pages and enhancing the CPU scheduler to prevent overheads caused by inter-core communication and context switching. NetVM allows true zero-copy delivery of data to VMs both for packet processing and messaging among VMs within a trust boundary. Our evaluation shows how NetVM can compose complex network functionality from multiple pipelined VMs and still obtain throughputs up to 10 Gbps, an improvement of more than 250\% compared to existing techniques that use SR-IOV for virtualized networking.},

Anonymization is an important step before data sharing. Several organizations leverage on third parties for storing and managing data. However, third parties are often not trusted to store plaintext personal and sensitive data; data encryption is widely adopted to protect against intentional and unintentional attempts to read personal/sensitive data. Traditional encryption schemes do not support operations over the ciphertexts and thus anonymizing encrypted datasets is not feasible with current approaches. This paper explores the feasibility and depth of implementing a privacy-preserving data publishing workflow over encrypted datasets leveraging on homomorphic encryption. We demonstrate how we can achieve uniqueness discovery, data masking, differential privacy and k-anonymity over encrypted data requiring zero knowledge about the original values. We prove that the security protocols followed by our approach provide strong guarantees against inference attacks. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the performance of our data publishing workflow components.},

	abstract = {Large scale deployment of IoT devices has made Bluetooth Protocol (IEEE 802.15.1) the wireless protocol of choice for close-range communications. Devices such as keyboards, smartwatches, headphones, computer mouse, and various wearable connecting devices use Bluetooth network for communication. Moreover, Bluetooth networks are widely used in medical devices like heart monitors, blood glucose monitors, asthma inhalers, and pulse oximeters. Also, Bluetooth has replaced cables for wire-free equipment in a surgical environment. In hospitals, devices communicate with one another, sharing sensitive and critical information over Bluetooth scatter-networks. Thus, it is imperative to secure the Bluetooth networks against attacks like Man in the Middle attack (MITM), eavesdropping attacks, and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This paper presents a Multi-Level Bluetooth Intrusion Detection System (ML-BIDS) to detect malicious attacks against Bluetooth devices. In the ML-IDS framework, we perform continuous device identification and authorization in Bluetooth networks following the zero-trust principle [ref]. The ML-BIDS framework includes an anomaly-based intrusion detection system (ABIDS) to detect attacks on the Bluetooth protocol. The ABIDS tracks the normal behavior of the Bluetooth protocol by comparing it with the Bluetooth protocol state machine. Bluetooth frame flows consisting of Bluetooth frames received over 10 seconds are split into n-grams to track the current state of the protocol in the state machine. We evaluated the performance of several machine learning algorithms like C4.5, Adaboost, SVM, Naive Bayes, Jrip, and Bagging to classify normal Bluetooth protocol flows from abnormal Bluetooth protocol flows. The ABIDS detects attacks on Bluetooth protocols with a precision of up to 99.6\% and recall up to 99.6\%. The ML-BIDS framework also performs whitelisting of the devices on the Bluetooth network to prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network. ML-BIDS uses a combination of the Bluetooth Address, mac address, and IP address to uniquely identify a Bluetooth device connecting to the network, and hence ensuring only authorized devices can connect to the Bluetooth network.},

	abstract = {Federated learning engages a set of edge devices to collaboratively train a common model without sharing their local data and has advantage in user privacy over traditional cloud-based learning approaches. However, recent model inversion attacks and membership inference attacks have demonstrated that shared model updates during the interactive training process could still leak sensitive user information. Thus, it is desirable to provide rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantee in federated learning. The main challenge to providing DP is to maintain high utility of federated learning model with repeatedly introduced randomness of DP mechanisms, especially when the server is not fully trusted. In this paper, we investigate how to provide DP to the most widely adopted federated learning scheme, federated averaging. Our approach combines local gradient perturbation, secure aggregation, and zero-concentrated differential privacy (zCDP) for better utility and privacy protection without a trusted server. We jointly consider the performance impacts of randomnesses introduced by the DP mechanism, client sampling and data subsampling in our approach, and theoretically analyze the convergence rate and end-to-end DP guarantee with non-convex loss functions. We also demonstrate that our proposed method has good utility-privacy trade-off through extensive numerical experiments on the real-world dataset.},

	doi = {10.1145/2830772.2830795},
	abstract = {Trusted applications frequently execute in tandem with untrusted applications on personal devices and in cloud environments. Since these co-scheduled applications share hardware resources, the latencies encountered by the untrusted application betray information about whether the trusted applications are accessing shared resources or not. Prior studies have shown that such information leaks can be used by the untrusted application to decipher keys or launch covert-channel attacks. Prior work has also proposed techniques to eliminate information leakage in various shared resources. The best known solution to eliminate information leakage in the memory system incurs high performance penalties. This work develops a comprehensive approach to eliminate timing channels in the memory controller that has two key elements: (i) We shape the memory access behavior of each thread so that it has an unchanging memory access pattern. (ii) We show how efficient memory access pipelines can be constructed to process the resulting memory accesses without introducing any resource conflicts. We mathematically show that the proposed system yields zero information leakage. We then show that various page mapping policies can impact the throughput of our secure memory system. We also introduce techniques to re-order requests from different threads to boost performance without leaking information. Our best solution offers throughput that is 27\% lower than that of an optimized non-secure baseline, and that is 69\% higher than the best known competing scheme.},

	abstract = {With the advent of 5G and technologies such as cloud computing, Internet-of-Things (IoT), etc, future communication networks will consist of a large number of heterogeneous devices connected together. A critical aspect will be ensuring that communication is not only fast and reliable, but also resilient to malicious attack. As networks increasingly adopt zero-trust principles in their security frameworks, it is important to consider such attacks from a zero-trust perspective. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of communicating a message reliably across a binary erasure channel (BEC( q )) or a binary symmetric channel (BSC( q )) against an adversary actively injecting additional erasures or flips at the channel’s input. The adversary can corrupt up to a fraction p of the transmitted bits and knows the transmission scheme agreed upon by the communicating terminals. Further, he has the capability to causally snoop in on both the transmitter and the receiver in real time, i.e., if {\textbackslash}mathbf x=(x\_1,x\_2,{\textbackslash}ldots, x\_n) and {\textbackslash}mathbf y=(y\_1,y\_2,{\textbackslash}ldots, y\_n) denote the transmitted and the received codewords respectively, at each time k , he knows (x\_1,x\_2,{\textbackslash}ldots, x\_k) and (y\_1,y\_2,{\textbackslash}ldots, y\_k-1) . Using his side-information, the adversary is free to employ any attack that respects his constraint on the number of corruptible bits. We prove an information-theoretic tight capacity characterization as a function of p and q for (i) the erasure adversary with a BEC( q ) and (ii) the bit-flip adversary with a BSC( q ). A unique feature of our models is the compounding of stochastic and adversarial noise sources. Our analysis reveals the worst-case adversarial attacks for both models and proves the existence of coding schemes that achieve rates equal to the capacity for any adversarial attack. In the case of bit-flips, we show that, interestingly, when p is below a certain threshold (that depends on q ), the adversary is no worse than an i.i.d. memory-less noise source.},

	doi = {10.1109/SEED55351.2022.00014},
	abstract = {Data breaches that penetrate web-facing servers and exfiltrate sensitive user data have become pervasive. Insulating these systems from attack is seemingly impossible due to the ubiquity of software vulnerabilities within cloud applications. It is simply insurmountable to adequately address all such vulnerabilities, and therefore imprudent to rely on software applications to protect user data. Rather, the ideal systems solution upholds data confidentiality, even in the presence of vulnerable or compromised software. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides these capabilities, but its limited expressiveness and significant runtime overheads have inhibited its adoption. In this work, we explore how trusted hardware can be leveraged to provide data confidentiality in the presence of vulnerable software while achieving practical performance overheads. We present Sequestered Encryption (SE)—a hardware technique for data privacy that sequesters sensitive plaintext data into a small hardware root of trust and encrypts this data in all external microarchitectural structures, thereby rendering secret values inaccessible to software. With optimizations, SE achieves {\textless}2.5× performance slowdowns on average compared to native execution, demonstrating that architectural approaches can emerge as data privacy solutions that possess zero trust in software while being dynamic, expressive, and performant.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way of how pervasive computing devices communicate and disseminate information over the global network. A plethora of user data is collected and logged daily into cloud-based servers. Such data can be analyzed by the IoT infrastructure to capture users' behaviors (e.g. users' location, tagging of smart home occupancy). This brings a new set of security challenges, specifically user anonymity. Existing access control and authentication technologies failed to support user anonymity. They relied on the surrendering of the device/user authentication parameters to the trusted server, which hence could be utilized by the IoT infrastructure to track users' behavioral patterns. This paper, presents two novel configurable privacy-preserving authentication schemes. User anonymity capabilities were incorporated into our proposed authentication schemes through the implementation of two crypto-based approaches (i) Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) and (ii) Verifiable Common Secret Encoding (VCSE). We consider a user-oriented approach when determining user anonymity. The proposed authentication schemes are dynamically capable of supporting various levels of user privacy based on the user preferences. To validate the two schemes, they were fully implemented and deployed on an IoT testbed. We have tested the performance of each proposed schemes in terms of power consumption and computation time. Based on our performance evaluation results, the proposed ZKP-based approach provides better performance compared to the VCSE-based approach.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has been a research focus in both academic and industrial communities for decades. Along with this trend, Searchable Encryption (SE) technology emerged and developed as data privacy concerns increased. Many schemes are proposed to solve the privacy-preserving data-sharing problem in multi-user scenarios. Most existing solutions are based on the assumption that all users are trusted. However, there will be cross-user leakage when there are malicious or compromised ones. This is because of the inherent linkability of authorization information and the search result when multiple users request data from the same database. To this end, we propose a cross-user leakage mitigation scheme for authorized encrypted data sharing in a two-server model. We utilize a blinding factor to delink authorizations based on Symmetric Multi-Key Searchable Encryption (SMKSE). To break the linkability of query results, we combine the zero-sum garbled Bloom filter with the oblivious transfer technique, where each of the two servers can only know partial information. We devise a group-based Bloom filter structure in indices to improve efficiency. We perform formal security analysis and also demonstrate the efficiency through comparative experiments.},
