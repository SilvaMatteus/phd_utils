	abstract = {With increasing digitization, more and more people use their identification credentials for accessing online services; which increases concern for data privacy. To ensure user's privacy, alternate credential management schemes must be adopted. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a form of credential management where users are in charge of their credentials. Privacy-critical data is stored at the user's end and they can choose to do selective disclosure of minimal required information to access services. Currently, SSI solutions are not being widely adopted by service providers and the ecosystem is fragmented. One of the reasons for the lack of adoption is the need for maintaining private infrastructure for credential issuance, as critical user information is to be handled during credential issuance. To cater to this, we present a solution that enables the service providers to run their credential issuers on public cloud - a so-called Credentials as a Service (CaaS). CaaS issuers run inside Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) enabling credential issuers to ensure user's privacy while enjoying the flexibility of the pay-per-use cloud model. CaaS can pave the way for making SSI credentials ubiquitous in identity management solutions.},

	abstract = {While many cloud storage systems allow users to protect their data by making use of encryption, only few support collaborative editing on that data. A major challenge for enabling such collaboration is the need to enforce cryptographic access control policies in a secure and efficient manner. In this paper, we introduce IBBE-SGX, a new cryptographic access control extension that is efficient both in terms of computation and storage even when processing large and dynamic workloads of membership operations, while at the same time offering zero knowledge guarantees. IBBE-SGX builds upon Identity-Based Broadcasting Encryption (IBBE). We address IBBE's impracticality for cloud deployments by exploiting Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to derive cuts in the computational complexity. Moreover, we propose a group partitioning mechanism such that the computational cost of membership update is bound to a fixed constant partition size rather than the size of the whole group. We have implemented and evaluated our new access control extension. Results highlight that IBBE-SGX performs membership changes 1.2 orders of magnitude faster than the traditional approach of Hybrid Encryption (HE), producing group metadata that are 6 orders of magnitude smaller than HE, while at the same time offering zero knowledge guarantees.},

In order to assess the current state of such solutions, the access to three whitelisting solution licenses was obtained with the purpose to test their effectiveness against different modern types of ransomware found in the wild. To conduct this study a virtual environment was used with Windows Server and Enterprise editions installed. The objective of this paper is not to evaluate each vendor or make recommendations of purchasing specific software but rather to assess the ability of application control solutions to block execution of ransomware files, as well as assess the potential for future research. The results of the research show the promise and effectiveness of whitelisting solutions.},

	abstract = {Task offloading to edge servers has become a promising solution to tackle the computation resource poverty of the end devices. However, the zero-trust edge computing platform is highly challenged by the growing concern on security and privacy. Thus, Trust Execution Environment (TEE), like TrustZone, is advocated to empower edge clouds to enable secure task offloading. To explore TrustZone, the inevitable involvement of data encryption and decryption operations makes existing offloading strategies not applicable any more, especially when the task dependency is considered. In addition, TrustZone has distinguishable task scheduling paradigm as one CPU core does not allow multitask coexist at the same time. Taking the above issues into consideration, we investigate a dependency-aware task offloading problem for makespan minimization in TrustZone empowered edge clouds. By inventing an extended graph to describe the task execution process, we provide a formal statement to the problem and prove its NP-hardness. We then propose a Customized List Scheduling (CLS) based approximate algorithm and theoretically analyze its achievable performance. Extensive testbed based experiment results show that our approximation algorithm can effectively reduce the makespan and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art offloading approaches in TrustZone empowered edge clouds.},

	abstract = {Existing attestation mechanisms lack scalability and support for heterogeneous virtual execution environments (VEEs), such as virtual machines and containers executed inside or outside hardware isolation on different vendors' hardware in clouds managed by various organizations. To overcome these limitations, hardware vendors and cloud providers implement proprietary mechanisms (Intel DCAP, Amazon NitroTPM, Google Titan) to support their offerings. However, due to their plurality, the attestation becomes cumbersome because it increases maintenance and integration costs and reduces portability required in hybrid- and multi-cloud deployments. We introduce WAWEL, a framework that enables scalable attestation of heterogeneous VEEs. WAWEL can be plugged into existing hardware-specific attestation mechanisms, offering a unified interface. WAWEL supports the widely adopted trusted platform module (TPM) attestation standard. We implemented a prototype and integrated it with three different VEEs. It supports runtime integrity attestation with Linux integrity measurement architecture (IMA) and legacy applications requiring zero-code changes. The evaluation demonstrated that the WAWEL prototype achieves very good performance and scalability despite the indirections between the VEE and hardware root of trust.},

	doi = {10.1109/EuroSP.2017.28},
	abstract = {Trusted hardware systems, such as Intel's new SGX instruction set architecture extension, aim to provide strong confidentiality and integrity assurances for applications. Recent work, however, raises serious concerns about the vulnerability of such systems to side-channel attacks. We propose, formalize, and explore a cryptographic primitive called a Sealed-Glass Proof (SGP) that models computation possible in an isolated execution environment with unbounded leakage, and thus in the face of arbitrary side-channels. A SGP specifically models the capabilities of trusted hardware that can attest to correct execution of a piece of code, but whose execution is transparent, meaning that an application's secrets and state are visible to other processes on the same host. Despite this strong threat model, we show that SGPs enable a range of practical applications. Our key observation is that SGPs permit safe verifiable computing in zero-knowledge, as data leakage results only in the prover learning her own secrets. Among other applications, we describe the implementation of an end-to-end bug bounty (or zero-day solicitation) platform that couples a SGX-based SGP with a smart contract. Our platform enables a marketplace that achieves fair exchange, protects against unfair bounty withdrawals, and resists denial-of-service attacks by dishonest sellers. We also consider a slight relaxation of the SGP model that permits black-box modules instantiating minimal, side-channel resistant primitives, yielding a still broader range of applications. Our work shows how trusted hardware systems such as SGX can support trustworthy applications even in the presence of side channels.},

Then, SPDTS takes full advantage of the dispersibility and immutability of blockchain to ensure the reliability of data transactions. To keep the transaction process efficient, the processing tasks for power data are performed under smart contract. Meanwhile, a trusted execution environment (TEE) is adopted to guarantee the security of power data. Finally, we present a differential privacy scheme to safeguard the privacy information in the power data. Our study indicates that the proposed scheme can achieve privacy protection, transaction security and data reliability.

	abstract = {Data breaches that penetrate web-facing servers and exfiltrate sensitive user data have become pervasive. Insulating these systems from attack is seemingly impossible due to the ubiquity of software vulnerabilities within cloud applications. It is simply insurmountable to adequately address all such vulnerabilities, and therefore imprudent to rely on software applications to protect user data. Rather, the ideal systems solution upholds data confidentiality, even in the presence of vulnerable or compromised software. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides these capabilities, but its limited expressiveness and significant runtime overheads have inhibited its adoption. In this work, we explore how trusted hardware can be leveraged to provide data confidentiality in the presence of vulnerable software while achieving practical performance overheads. We present Sequestered Encryption (SE)—a hardware technique for data privacy that sequesters sensitive plaintext data into a small hardware root of trust and encrypts this data in all external microarchitectural structures, thereby rendering secret values inaccessible to software. With optimizations, SE achieves {\textless}2.5× performance slowdowns on average compared to native execution, demonstrating that architectural approaches can emerge as data privacy solutions that possess zero trust in software while being dynamic, expressive, and performant.},

	abstract = {The panic among medical control, information, and device administrators is due to surmounting number of high-profile attacks on healthcare facilities. This hostile situation is going to lead the health informatics industry to cloud-hoarding of medical data, control flows, and site governance. While different healthcare enterprises opt for cloud-based solutions, it is a matter of time when fog computing environment are formed. Because of major gaps in reported techniques for fog security administration for health data i.e. absence of an overarching certification authority (CA), the security provisioning is one of the the issue that we address in this paper. We propose a security provisioning model (AZSPM) for medical devices in fog environments. We propose that the AZSPM can be build by using atomic security components that are dynamically composed. The verification of authenticity of the atomic components, for trust sake, is performed by calculating the processor clock cycles from service execution at the resident hardware platform. This verification is performed in the fully sand boxed environment. The results of the execution cycles are matched with the service specifications from the manufacturer before forwarding the mobile services to the healthcare cloud-lets. The proposed model is completely novel in the fog computing environments. We aim at building the prototype based on this model in a healthcare information system environment.},

In the absence of literature on security provisioning frameworks that connect VANETs and HEs, this paper presents a smart zero-knowledge proof and statistical fingerprinting-based trusted secure communication framework for a fog computing environment. A zero-knowledge proof is used for vehicle authentication, and statistical fingerprinting is employed to secure communication between VANETs and HEs. Authenticity verification of the operations is performed at the on-board unit (OBU) fitted in the vehicle based on the service executions at the resident hardware platform. The processor clock cycles are acquired from the service executions in a complete sandboxed environment. The calculated cycles assist in developing the blueprint signature for the particular OBU of the vehicle. Hence, the fingerprint signature helps build trust and plays a key role in authenticating the vehicle's horizontal movement to everything or to different sections of the HEs.

Recently, several researchers have sought to achieve privacy-preserving auditing, which is a crucial function for scenarios that require regulatory compliance, for decentralized payment systems. However, those proposed schemes usually cost much time for the cooperation between the auditor and the user due to leveraging complex cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proof. To tackle the problem, we present T-PPA, a privacy-preserving decentralized payment system, which provides customizable and efficient auditability by leveraging trusted execution environments (TEEs). T-PPA demands the auditor construct audit programs based on request and execute them in the TEE to protect the privacy of transactions. Then, identity-based encryption (IBE) is employed to construct the separation of power between the agency nodes and the auditor and to protect the privacy of transactions out of TEE. The experimental results show that T-PPA can achieve privacy-preserving audits with acceptable overhead.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology and its applications are gaining popularity day by day. It is a ground-breaking technology that allows users to communicate without the need of a trusted middleman. A smart contract (self-executable code) is deployed on the blockchain and auto executes due to a triggering condition. In a no-trust contracting environment, smart contracts can establish trust among parties. Terms and conditions embedded in smart contracts will be imposed immediately when specified criteria have been fulfilled. Due to this, the malicious assailants have a special interest in smart contracts. Blockchains are immutable means if some transaction is deployed or recorded on the blockchain, it becomes unalterable. Thus, smart contracts must be analyzed to ensure zero security vulnerabilities or flaws before deploying the same on the blockchain because a single vulnerability can lead to the loss of millions. For analyzing the security vulnerabilities of smart contracts, various analysis tools have been developed to create safe and secure smart contracts. This paper presents a systematic review on Ethereum smart contracts analysis tools. Initially, these tools are categorized into static and dynamic analysis tools. Thereafter, different sources code analysis techniques are studied such as taint analysis, symbolic execution, and fuzzing techniques. In total, 86 security analysis tools developed for Ethereum blockchain smart contract are analyzed regardless of tool type and analysis approach. Finally, the paper highlights some challenges and future recommendations in the field of Ethereum smart contracts.},

	abstract = {Permissionless blockchain systems such as Bitcoin or Ethereum are slow and expensive, since transactions are processed in a distributed network by a large set of parties. To improve on these shortcomings, a prominent approach is given by so-called 2nd-layer protocols. In these protocols parties process transactions off-chain directly between each other, thereby drastically reducing the costly and slow interaction with the blockchain. In particular, in the optimistic case, when parties behave honestly, no interaction with the blockchain is needed. One of the most popular off-chain solutions are Plasma protocols (often also called commit-chains). These protocols are orchestrated by a so-called operator that maintains the system and processes transactions between parties. Importantly, the operator is trustless, i.e., even if it is malicious users of the system are guaranteed to not lose funds. To achieve this guarantee, Plasma protocols are highly complex and rely on involved and expensive dispute resolution processes. This has significantly slowed down development and deployment of these systems.In this work we propose CommiTEE – a simple and efficient Plasma system leveraging the power of trusted execution environments (TEE). Besides its simplicity, our protocol requires minimal interaction with the blockchain, thereby drastically reducing costs and improving efficiency. An additional benefit of our solution is that it allows for switching between operators, in case the main operator goes offline due to system failure, or behaving maliciously. We implemented and evaluated our system over Ethereum and show that it is at least 2 times (and in some cases more than 16 times) cheaper in terms of communication complexity when compared to existing Plasma implementations. Moreover, for protocols using zero-knowledge proofs (like NOCUST-ZKP), CommiTEE decreases the on-chain gas cost by a factor ≈ 19 compared to prior solution.},
