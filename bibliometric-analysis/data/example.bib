	abstract = {The migration of traditional deployment to clouds has driven the need for a more robust security model, the Zero-Trust model. The application of zero-trust principles addresses known security issues such as lateral movement attacks but adds extra identity management complexity. In addition, to cover a broader range of attacks, one must think of strategies to protect data, code, and credentials in such applications. Confidential computing aims to fulfill this goal. Nevertheless, confidential computing is even more complex to implement than Zero-Trust. In this work, we combine the Zero-Trust model with confidential computing by leveraging the SPIFFE standard through its reference implementation (SPIRE), and Intel SGX through the SCONE framework, to seamlessly supply software identities to confidential microservices. Furthermore, we also protected the whole identity-provisioning stack with Intel SGX and assessed the performance overhead. We believe this combination not only improves the security of SPIFFE deployments but also leverages SPIFFE to facilitate the integration between confidential computing components and native applications.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICOCO56118.2022.10031702},
	abstract = {Recently, remote work has become popular due to the widespread of infectious diseases. Many organizations and companies have turned to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) in an attempt to provide secure remote access to their on-premises infrastructure. However, intensive access to such VPN devices places a heavy burden on network performance, and there is also a high risk of cyber-attacks targeting them. Therefore, the demand for zero trust architecture without using VPN devices is increasing these days. However, it takes much time for organizations to introduce a zero trust architecture. Furthermore, it is difficult for some organizations to implement the so-called “ideal zero trust environment” because of some security problems and confidential information management. Thus, it is expected that a hybrid environment in which a zero trust architecture and a conventional on-premises environment coexist is introduced at first in many organizations. In this environment, access logs for each service are distributed in both cloud and on-premise servers. Thus, conventional log-based anomaly detection methods will not work well. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting unauthorized access to such a hybrid environment using machine learning and verify its effectiveness in a virtual environment. As a result, we detect abnormal behavior with high accuracy. Furthermore, based on the experimental results, we discuss how logs should be collected and what kind of log information is useful for anomaly detection in hybrid environments.},

	abstract = {To reduce the transmission cost of blockchain confidential transactions, we propose SymmeProof, a novel communication efficient non-interactive zero-knowledge range proof protocol without a trusted setup. We design and integrate two new techniques in SymmeProof, namely vector compression and inner-product range proof. The proposed vector compression is able to reduce the communication cost to {\textbackslash}log (n)log(n) for nn-size vectors. The proposed inner-product range proof converts a range proof relation into an inner-product form, which can further reduce the range proof size with the vector compression technique. Based on these two techniques, SymmeProof can eventually achieve a {\textbackslash}log (n)log(n)-size range proof. The proposed SymmeProof can be used in many important applications such as blockchain confidential transactions as well as arguments for arithmetic circuit satisfiability. We evaluate the performance of SymmeProof. The results show that SymmeProof substantially outperforms representative methods such as Bulletproofs in the proof size without a trusted setup.},

Nonetheless, due to the transparent nature of the blockchain, privacy and confidentiality are still a major concern for industries. In this paper, we present zk-BeSC, a blockchain enabled supply chain scheme based on zero-knowledge proofs of polynomials. The scheme allows transactions between supply chain participants in a privacy preserving fashion. It also offers tamper-resistance and replication due to the intrinsic nature of the blockchain. ZK-BeSC is fully implemented using an ethereum testnet and a web3 application. The scheme performs efficient proofs and has reduced gas consumption during verification.},

In this research, we monitor account's behavior such clickstreams on the browser and incorporate it to evaluation of user's trust in access control system. Through the construction of behavior-based ZTAC system based on clickstreams, we have achieved access control that considers the naturalness of clicks without relying on the results of authentication. Moreover, toward solving the mismatch of click count between the system side and the end-user side, we synchronously updated the clickstream by the user-agent which observing and retrieving the click events in the DOM. As experimental evaluation, we verified that our ZTAC can deal with click count discrepancy and completely prevent various insider threat to sensitive data from even authenticated accounts. Also, we confirmed no significant differences in response time, memory usage, or CPU usage before and after the migration of zero-trust, indicating that it can be deployed in existing enterprise networks.},

	abstract = {Blockchain platforms are generally applied to automate operations using a trusted environment with broadcast messaging and distributed data storing. At the same time corporates still have business requirements to also send confidential peer-to-peer messages or private transactions. Mainly these requirements derive from the law obligations (bank secrecy, GDPR, etc.) and the necessity to protect competitive market advantages. Blockchain platforms for public networks ignore requirements for private transactions due to user anonymity and the absence of personal data in blockchain networks. Enterprise blockchain platforms for corporate networks mostly address confidential issues by transferring private data through trusted third parties (TTP) or intermediaries, and off-chain peer-to-peer messaging. However, these approaches miss core blockchain advantages of a trusted environment - immutability and integrity of private data. This article introduces a new technique and its implementation of private transactions in a blockchain that is based on both off-chain peer-to-peer messaging with confidential data and broadcast transactions that contain hashes of private data to verify immutability and integrity. The article provides technical details of the method, also performance issues are discussed.},

	abstract = {The electronics supply chain has adapted into a global process over the past two decades to support the cost of process optimization. As the semiconductor industry has transitioned from a vertical to the horizontal business model, the perceived vulnerability of integrated circuit (IC) design, and fabrication has grown dramatically. Design intellectual property (IP) is the defining characteristic of most fabless design houses and integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) within the supply chain, and as such, holds significant value for market competitiveness, and in some cases, national security. Malicious insiders threaten the confidentiality of this proprietary technology. To prevent IP piracy, we redefine the modern threat landscape by considering nearly every individual in the IC design and fabrication process untrusted. Therefore, we propose a novel framework to assure confidential electronic design against insider threats, termed ACED-IT, that enables maintaining the confidentiality of the design when it traverses through different design stages (e.g., RTL/Gate-level to GDSII). ACED-IT integrates encryption, logic locking, novel temporary-inserted logic elements (TILEs), access controls, and action logging, to protect the design IP from insider threats originating from any entity in the process. ACED-IT is compatible with the current industry development flow and provides all engineers with the tools to complete their roles. The proposed ACED-IT framework is demonstrated across various benchmarks and analyzed for security. Benchmarks processed using ACED-IT incurred negligible overhead across parameters such as power, area, timing, and test coverage after functional recovery, and provided a brute force attack complexity to recover the original design exceeding that of AES-256.},

In this article, we revisit the design of ring confidential transaction protocol and put forward a more efficient privacy-preserving payment protocol, which is built upon an extended version of one-out-of-many proof and a special multi-signature. Compared with previous works, the new protocol is not only more practical, but also does not suffer from a trusted setup. Besides, we show that the protocol satisfies the security requirements provided that the underlying cryptographic primitives are secure in the random oracle model. We implement our new payment protocol in Java, and the experimental results show that it is efficient enough to be used in practice.},

That is, the gateway distributes the information to a predefined group of users and only the privileged user can open the message. To solve this problem, we need an access control mechanism to allow certain specification of the access control policies while protecting the users' privacy. With this scenario in mind, we propose the notion of verifiable and anonymous encryption where a verification function is added to the ciphertext, which captures the security requirements of the confidentiality of the plaintext and the anonymity of the privileged user. We present two specific constructions of our framework under the setting of asymmetric bilinear pairings in this paper. Our first scheme is proven confidential and anonymous under a weaker security model in the random oracle model, and our second one is built on the basis of a zero knowledge proof of knowledge under a strong security game.},

To implement applications among restricted parties with permission such as asset sales and trades, a special type of blockchain system called a private blockchain is used. Additionally, the demand for privacy preservation where sensitive information such as the trade amounts and balances is not disclosed is increasing. However, privacy preservation in a typical blockchain setting is difficult because it prevents parties that are not involved in the transaction from checking the correctness of the transaction being processed, which may lead to unintended or invalid transactions. To address this issue, herein we propose a protocol that allows the consistency with regard to the transaction amount and the balance to be checked without disclosing their values. Specifically, we exploit a homomorphic encryption to encrypt the transaction amount and balance. Thus, the correctness of a transaction can be publicly verified by the parties using the zero-knowledge proof without a trusted third party.},

The DBF is shown to convey confidential messages with a capacity scaling of 1/2 log K regardless of the trustworthiness of the relays, even without intended jamming (IJ), where 1/2 log K corresponds to the maximal capacity scaling of cooperative relaying in non-eavesdropping environments. However, using multiple untrustworthy relays worsens the secrecy performance of the OR, and as K increases, the secrecy capacity converges to zero. When secrecy outage performance with IJ is considered, the achievable diversity order for both the DBF and OR is limited to one. However, only the DBF exploits the benefits using multiple untrustworthy relays, and its secrecy outage probability decreases exponentially as K increases.},

Unfortunately, memory-unsafe and type-unsafe programming languages, such as C/C++, are commonly used to develop enclave implementations. As a result, a memory corruption or a data race within enclaves could lead to different attacks against the enclaves, such as Return-Of-Programming (ROP) and data leakage, breaking the hardware security guarantee provided by SGX. To automatically identify these issues in existing enclave implementations, in this paper, we propose FuzzSGX, an input and program mutation-based fuzzer for Intel SGX enclave implementations. FuzzSGX provides an enclave fuzzing runtime, FuzzSGX Runtime, a drop-in library for Intel SGX SDK, enabling code coverage and sanitization within enclaves. To explore the host app-enclave boundary, FuzzSGX conducts static analysis and symbolic execution on existing host apps and enclave implementations to generate promising fuzzing programs, fuzzing both ECALLs and OCALLs. We evaluate FuzzSGX using 30 popular SGX applications and enclave implementations and find 93 bugs among these SGX projects, including data races, null pointer dereferences, out-of-bound accesses, division-by-zero, etc. FuzzSGX achieves 3.2x higher code coverage and finds 48.2\% more bugs by directly targeting the host appenclave boundary by using program mutations, compared to state-of-the-art fuzzers.},

	abstract = {The expansion of internet escalated banking to a new level and has raised tremendous opportunities of joint transactions in which multiple banks cooperatively conduct some computation. Such computations use confidential data of the involved banks to compute the result. As the concerned data is private for the owning organization, its security is prime concern. Privacy preservation concern rises as no party can be trusted enough to know all the inputs of computation. In this paper we have proposed a scalable and efficient protocol to perform secure multi-party computations on encrypted data. The process involves encrypting data in a manner that it does not affect the result of the computation. Virtual parties are created by all organizations and encrypted data is distributed among them. Modifier tokens are generated along encryption which are assigned to virtual parties, and finally used in the computation. The computation function uses the acquired data and modifier tokens to compute result. As the data involved in computation was encrypted, without revealing the data right result can be computed and privacy of the parties is maintained. The protocol is highly efficient in conducting banking computations. We have analyzed the security and complexity of protocol and shown how zero hacking security can be achieved. Also we have analyzed the performance through various tests.},
